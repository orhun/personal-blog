was a crazy simulation. A lot of glitches, plot twists and fun stuff™.\nIt was equally un-fun and chaotic as well.\nIn this post I want to document the lore and share my plans for the next year.\n\"Only way to move forward is to look back.\"\n— Text on a random guy's T-shirt at the gym\nIntro\nProjects\nTravels\nCommunities\nHealth\nExtras\nClosing\nIntro\nThroughout the year I felt like Sisyphus, always working on stuff and expecting things to change or get better.\nThen I realized that's the point, you just gotta keep rolling that damn boulder up the hill.\nIt was fun though, I have:\ntraveled to many places,\nworked on computers,\nbuilt communities,\nand benched 100kg.\nProjects\nRatatui\ngit-cliff\nRatzilla\nTuitar\nALPM\ncargo-tui\nRatatui\nI have worked on Ratatui for the whole year...\nAnd as we are wrapping up the year, we have released the biggest version of Ratatui yet: 0.30.0\nThis excites me for many reasons but most prominently because Ratatui is now no_std, meaning that it can be used without the Rust standard library.\nThis opens up a lot of doors for experiments, e.g. running Ratatui on Cortex-M microcontrollers and a bunch of other environments.\nSpeaking of Ratatuifying, we ran a challenge called Rat in the Wild this year. And we have gifted aprons to several people who have managed to run Ratatui on crazy platforms, including an actual car dashboard.\nFor me the TUI of the year was gitlogue ⭐\nWatch your repo code itself.\ngit-cliff\ngit-cliff is my solo project that I have been working on and off for several years now.\nI really enjoy tackling Git issues and automating changelog generation with new features.\nThis year, I have released 4 new versions of the project, the latest one being 2.11.0.\nAlso, I have done a special T-shirt giveaway to celebrate reaching 10k stars on GitHub.\nThe winner of the giveaway already sent me a pic from the gym wearing the T-shirt! 💪\nRatzilla\nThis was my first big grind of the year. I submitted a talk to FOSDEM, got accepted and speedran to build this crazy idea.\nNow you can render TUIs directly in the browser using DOM, Canvas or WebGL backends!\nThe following demo embeds a Ratatui application compiled to WebAssembly, initialized in the browser and injected into a static Zola layout:\nYou can press arrow keys to interact with it.\nTuitar\nAfter my Superbooth trip this year, I got inspired to build a guitar practice tool.\nThis was my second big grind and it was also a talk-driven project. I simply submitted a talk to Rust Forge, got accepted and forced myself to build it.\nRecently it got featured on Hackster.io which made me very happy!\nOrhun Parmaksız is not only learning the guitar, but he is also a hardware hacker.\nHe created what he calls Tuitar, which is a portable, ESP32-powered guitar training tool.\nIt helps improve one’s playing skills, and can also be used to aid in perfectly tuning a guitar.\nTuitar is available as a DIY kit, so anyone in need of a little help can build their own.\nFollow @tuitardev on X to not miss any updates!\nI also got a bass guitar recently to experiment with bass support for Tuitar.\nALPM\nFor the past year I have done contracting work for Arch Linux in the context of the ALPM project (backed by Sovereign Tech Agency). In the scope of this work, we have implemented modern Rust libraries for interacting with packages, repositories and databases.\nDuring this time, I have specifically learned how to write custom parsers (with winnow) and deserializers for old file formats.\nOne day pacman will be fully oxidized! 🦀\ncargo-tui\nThis was my last big grind of the year and I'm still working on it.

In this post, I will share my notes/adventures on setting up a packaging environment and a tool called \"alpkg\" for automating this process.\nMy first interest in Alpine Linux began when I first started to containerize my open source projects using lightweight Alpine containers. I especially like to follow this approach for Rust applications because the sizes of traditional (glibc) distro containers like Debian/Ubuntu can go up to 200-300MB due to bloat whereas Alpine (musl) containers can stay so minimal such as only 3 MB!\nHere is an example Dockerfile from rustypaste that results in a 3MB image when built/compressed:\nOne thing to note here, I especially choose scratch image as the runner since it is super minimal. You can get similar results with images like distroless as well.\nAlthough you need to deal with compiling with musl sometimes, it is worth the hassle when the result is that satisfying. Other things that are different in Alpine are the following:\nFor more information about Alpine, check out this post which goes into detail about why it's neat.\nNow, let's talk about how to set up a packaging environment for Alpine Linux.\nOverview\nIn my specific case, I would like to keep using my Arch Linux system and also package for Alpine Linux. There are a couple of options for doing that:\nRun Alpine Linux on a virtual machine\nRun Alpine Linux in a chroot\nUse a Docker/Podman container with persistent storage\nI immediately eliminated the first option since I didn't want to deal with VM software and thought it would add extra complexity to my setup.\nThen I spun up a Docker container that runs Alpine and tried to make the storage persistent. After coming across this StackOverflow post, it turned out to be something harder than I expected and I started to feel like I was re-inventing VMs due to all those mount-binds and permissions. Unsurprisingly enough, I ditched that idea as well.\nLater on, I came across this great article on Alpine Wiki about creating a chroot:\nInside the chroot environment, you can build, debug, and run Alpine packages or develop things. It's the most known way to do so without replacing your system or using a Virtual Machine.\nThis is exactly what I needed!\nAfter settling on what to use, I had a plan in mind and came up with this diagram:\nLet's break it down:\nEverything is running inside Arch Linux.\nThere is a chroot container that holds the package sources and Alpine SDK tools needed.\nIn Alpine, packages are APKBUILD scripts that contain the build instructions for abuild tool.\nThere is a Git repository set up outside the chroot for adding/updating/deleting packages.\nFor interacting with the repositories, we can simply send a patch (i.e. merge request) to aports repositories which reside in gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports.\nWe only need to create a GitLab account and fork the repository, no special role is needed!\nSetting up the chroot\nalpine-chroot-install is a tool that automates the manual steps of creating a chroot. We can use it as follows:\nIn a couple of seconds, it will create a chroot and we can easily switch to it with the following script:\nAnd here we have Alpine Linux running inside Arch Linux!\nStory Time\nAfter I created the Alpine chroot, I played around a bit and tried out different features of apk package manager. I installed some of my favorite Rust tools and everything was working smoothly.\nThen I got an idea: I should try installing those tools during the chroot installation. Luckily, alpine-chroot-install has an option for it and you can simply use -p &lt;pkg&gt; for installing packages.\nOf course, I wanted to remove the chroot directory I just created before creating another chroot. For a second I thought chroot was just a simple directory and tried to delete it with rm -rf.\nOuch.\nHowever, chroot was not a regular directory. It has a bunch of things mounted to it:\nSo when I deleted chroot, I also deleted /dev x_x\nThen everything started to fail:\n/dev/null was also gone and I got errors like \"permission denied: /dev/null\" as well. Fun.\nLuckily a simple reboot fixes this issue. The scariest part was when everything started to throw errors left and right, I panicked and realized what I did. I was afraid I rm -rf'd my whole system but luckily it was just the mount points.\nLesson learned, I used the removal script for deleting the chroot next time: /chroot/destroy --remove.\nSetting up the packaging environment\nLet's install the necessary packages for packaging/development on Alpine:\nAfter that, we need to configure the build defaults in /etc/abuild.conf, especially the packager information:\nNext, we can configure the security keys:\nAfter this step, we are now ready for preparing APKBUILDs according to this guide and build them via abuild -r.\nSetting up the repository\nAfter forking the aports repository on GitLab, we can clone it somewhere on our main system and configure Git according to the packager information we have provided earlier in /etc/abuild.conf:\nOfficial documentation recommends adding the following Git hook for automatically generating the commit message based on the package that is being committed:\nThis hook will result in generating commit messages such as:\nNice.\nCreating packages\nAlpine Linux has a convenient tool called newapkbuild for generating APKBUILD prototypes based on the given parameters:\nIt is especially useful if you don't want to write the same boilerplate functions over and over again.\nIt can be used for Rust packages as follows:\nThis will generate the following APKBUILD in git-cliff directory:\nYou can read more about APKBUILD functions/variables in the official reference. With some edits, we can fit our project into this template easily. Here is the final APKBUILD:\nAfter we have the APKBUILD, we can use the following commands.\nTo generate checksums:\nTo build:\nTo lint:\nAfter the package is successfully built, there will be an apk file in the $HOME/packages directory. It is possible to list the apk contents with the following command:\nTo install the locally built package, we can update the repository index (/etc/apk/repositories) to point to the local directory and install it via apk:\nIf everything works fine, then congratulations, you just built your first Alpine package!\nSubmitting patches\nAlpine Linux has 3 repositories:\nmain: Directly supported official packages which are maintained by the Alpine core team.\nSimilar to core/extra repositories in Arch Linux.\ncommunity: Packages that are created by the contributors and developers. Not fully supported, maintenance is dependent on the contributor activity.\nSame as community repository on Arch Linux.\ntesting: New packages that are added by contributors. Packages from this repository are accepted into the community repository. This repository is only available on edge (development) branch of Alpine.\nSimilar to the AUR / testing repositories on Arch Linux.\nSince we have just created a new package, it will go to the testing repository. We can simply commit testing/&lt;package&gt;/APKBUILD and then create a merge request on GitLab.\nAnd there we go: https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/merge_requests/45319\nAfter the merge request is approved/merged, our package will show up on https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org:\nYay! git-cliff is now available for Alpine Linux!\nAutomating (mostly) everything with alpkg 🏔️\n⭐ GitHub: https://github.com/orhun/alpkg\nalpkg can create a chroot with preinstalled tools in a matter of seconds, set up aports repository, and fetch/update packages. Most importantly, it provides a split layout via Zellij for easy editing/building APKBUILD files.\nalpkg does everything that is mentioned earlier in this post and more. For example, in the GIF above:\nan Alpine chroot is created. (alpkg init)\nan existing APKBUILD is fetched. (alpkg fetch)\nAPKBUILD is edited and built. (alpkg edit)\nchanges are committed to aports. (alpkg update)\nLet's go over these features.\nCreating a chroot is as easy as running alpkg init. It also installs the SDK tools that we need and sets up the aports repository for us.\nWe can fetch and edit a APKBUILD via alpkg fetch. It will provide a split layout for both editing and other operations such as running abuild -r.\nTo create a new APKBUILD, we can simply use alpkg edit.\nLastly, if we want to commit the changes to aports, we can run alpkg update.\nYou can get more information about the tool and see detailed usage examples in the repository.\nEndnote\nAlpine Linux is neat. I'm really looking forward to oxidizing it (add more Rust packages to their repositories) and learning more about their implementation choices to eventually do more development. I'm glad how alpkg turned out and I'm planning to improve it based on my needs and the feedback from the Alpine community. I like automating things.\nHope you enjoyed reading and see you in the next one!","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/alpine-packaging-setup/","title":"Setting up a packaging environment for Alpine Linux (introducing alpkg)"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/am-i-a-musician-yet/":{"body":"I went to Berlin for a music event and here is what happened.\nIntro\nThere were moments in my engineering career where I simply wanted to say f*ck it and throw away my computer. Sometimes what we do as software laborers is either plain boring or easy to lead to burnout, so most of the people reading this have that feeling at least once I believe.\nApparently, I didn't drop everything or become violent towards my computer, but I often found myself playing around with other endavours when that happens, just to feel something again. It's subjective and different for everyone, for me, those f-it moments were always followed by the thought of becoming a musician, artist, rapper, or anything that is music-related. If you have been following me for a while on the internet, you might have gotten the hint from the songs that I share sometimes or music-related open source projects such as Linuxwave, so I have been taking some steps towards that dream for a while now.\nAlso, a couple of months ago, I got inspired and encouraged by my good friend Harun and got myself an electric guitar to play some of my favorite shoegaze/grunge tracks:\nPlaying an instrument after a long time really opened my eyes to why I was interested in music in the first place: it's the most direct way of conveying my emotions in an improvisational way. And recently I have been wanting to build a project that combines my love for music and software.\nIf you are new around, I'm maintaining Ratatui, a Rust library for building user interfaces in the terminal. There are already music-related projects built with it such as this Granular Sampler or this Music Live Coding application so I definitely want to hop on that train.\nAlso, we recently landed \"no_std\" support, which means you can run Ratatui on embedded devices as well. See this blog series for more information about that. But in a nutshell, you can now do things like:\nThere are endless possibilities for what to build! All I needed was some inspiration.\nThat's when my good friend David Runge came to my rescue. He's pretty active in the music scene in Berlin and maintains hella audio packages for Arch Linux. He mentioned Superbooth to me and it was definitely what I was looking for — a place where I can meet audio nerds and learn more about what people are building in the analog world.\nSo in this post I will be documenting my experience of \"going to Berlin for music\" and sharing my raw take on everything that I saw. It's going to be fun!\nDay 0x0\n- Travel to Berlin.\nWhile I'm waiting for my flight, I wanted to compile some general information about Superbooth:\nA trade fair for electronic musical instruments.\nFeatures a lot of exhibitors, manufacturers, and independent artists.\nHeld annually in Berlin, Germany.\nLooking at the website was enough to get me overwhelmed with the sheer number of events and booths that I had never heard of before. I did a quick research and took some notes for the interesting stuff that I want to see/visit:\nExhibitorNotes\nKORGOf course.\nFL StudioThe OG DAW\nFreaknoiseA synthesizer that produces nothing but melancholic sounds. WOW.\nSilhouetteSample audio, convert it to a picture file and then reuse it as visual material for the synthesis 👀\nMOOGThe OG synth builders.\nAbletonNever used it but heard it's good. Might switch to it one day.\nAKAIHey I have an AKAI MPK Mini MK3!\nFlowfalUsing smartwatch to control Ableton Live... what!?\nElektronDigitone II looks sick!\nArturiaI heard about Microfreak before!\nLandscapeLooks very interesting.\nafk audioNext-generation drum controller?? Interesting.\nAudio.computerThis looks very cute!\nBeetlecrab.audioThe vector synth demo is crazy.\nSonicwareI need to get my hands on CyDrums.\ndpw designApparently they do eurorack and pedals.\nBelaThey do open source embedded stuff, I definitely need to check this out.\nLeafaudioThey are making some interesting looking microphones.\nZlob ModularKickass logo, also the modules look sick.\nBeetronicsI play guitar, this is my sh*t.\nThere is definitely more stuff to check out... but that's all I could filter with a quick glance. Tomorrow, I'm hoping to visit as many things as I can!\nDay 0x1\n- First day of Superbooth for me.\nI woke up early to get myself familiar with the floorplan. This place is huuuuuge.\nAlright, let's go!\nHere are my highlights...\nZlob Modular\nFirst of all, they have a kickass logo and gear:\nThey are a small company that specializes in building modular synthesizers and effects, ranging from beginner-friendly utility modules to more advanced VCOs, VCFs, VCAs, LFOs, sample and hold modules, and attenuators.\nI attended the DIY workshop and built the Diode Chaos module.\nDiode Chaos is a small Eurorack module that creates random wiggly voltages and a chaotic trigger signal. It is an unique module and was inspired by the article called \"A simple chaotic circuit with a light-emitting diode\".\nIt took around 3 hours to complete the circuit.\nLast time I soldered was a while ago... Not that rusty, eh?\nHere is the final result:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nThanks Keven for the workshop and putting up with my boring questions! (:D)\nI'm currently lacking the equipment to use this in my music production setup as of now but building it was fun and useful either way I think. At least it gave me my confidence back about electronics (which I dove into quite a long time ago).\nFL Studio\nI paid my necessary visit to the booth — learning how to use FL Studio was one of the biggest milestones in my music career.\nSince I'm a super fan, I also got a FL Studio sticker and a legit tattoo in case I decide to get a tattoo of a carrot on my arm one day (💀).\nWe had a fun conversation about running FL Studio on Linux. It seems like quite a bit people were also doing that... (see my setup below)\nUnfortunately FL is written in Delphi so the guys at the booth told me that it's a bit difficult for them to release an official/native port on Linux anytime soon. Right now the only problem with FL running in Wine is that you are limited to the stock plugins... which is quite enough for me actually. But let's see!\nSOMA\nThey have very interesting instruments!\nFloating-hand-controlled thing (Soma Flux):\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nOr this thing (Soma Terra):\nIt's a wooden block with some metal spheres on it that you can touch. It produced heavenly sounds for me, but apparently you can use it for many purposes:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nMad Sound Factory\nI was just walking around the booths and all of a sudden found myself in the middle of a techno rave:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nThey have this thing called \"Drop\" which produces amazing tunes.\nI would love to get one for myself (or build something similar) one day!\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nMicrorack\nThey seem to have very easy-to-build synths that only require a breadboard!\nAlso, there was a funny synth that uses a microphone input, adds some effects and produces some autotune-like output.\nany frequency\nThey have built a synth that uses AI to learn from a given signal and accompany it by generating a signal that matches the tune.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nYou can also tweak the learning speed and all kinds of other parameters as well.\nBeetronics\nAs noted above, this was my sh*t.\nThey have some kickass pedals with hella functionality and it sounded amazing.\nUnfortunately they didn't bring a guitar to try things out which is a shame — I think it would be splendid to hear those with the guitar.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nAlso big props for their branding/marketing!\nChase Bliss\nAnother guitar-related booth which I like!\nAnd they had a small guitar (Steinberger Spirit) to try out their modules!\nBoom Kick\nIs an introduction needed? It's the .\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nAcidbooth\nMan I love acid.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nSilhouette\nSample audio, convert it to a picture file and then reuse it as visual material for the synthesis\nSaw that in action!\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nTechnoise\nKeven from Zlob and his friend Eliot were kind enough to invite me to a party that was happening in the evening after Superbooth.\nI showed up and it was literally an office turned into a stage with a bunch of synthesizers and free drinks :D\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nThe lineup was pretty interesting. Here are my highlights:\nKeven Onur Żłobnicki\nDefinitely interesting and different vibes.\nI felt like I was committing a financial crime the whole time.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nMakamqore\nDamn, Goblincore to the moon baby!\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nRMM (Robot Man Machine)\nMan I love acid.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nAnd here are some other videos that I took from the event:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nDay 0x2\n( - Feeling tired already...)\nWhile checking the schedule on my way in the morning, I realized there are still tickets available for Clacktronics workshop. So I went for it!\nClacktronics\nThey design and manufacture DIY synth and Eurorack products. They also have a \"Build Your Own Modular\" book which I find very useful!\nIn the workshop there were a couple of kits:\nVCO (voltage-controlled oscillator): for generating audio signals.\nVCF (voltage-controlled filter): for filtering audio signals.\nArpeggiator (stepped ramp generator): for generating arpeggios.\nI went with VCO since it's one of the fundamental modules in a synthesizer setup.\nThis was a quite fun kit to build!\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nIn the video you can hear the signals produced by the module and me playing with the knob:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nAt some point we added other modules (drums, filters, effects) and turned the workshop into an acid rave (Man I love acid btw):\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nThanks Ben for helping out with the workshop &amp; Simon letting me play around with his setup, it was super fun!\nNow I need to get myself a rack to play around with these modules myself when I get back home. 💀\nPlaying Around\nI spared the rest of the day for playing around with the various synthesizers, modules, instruments at the booths. There were many things that I touched and I definitely lost time at some point.\nI didn't take specific notes about the things that I tried out but here are some highlights:\nYamaha Seqtrak\nIt's just amazing. I cooked up some bangers on this. It is surprisingly easy to use and you can do many things.\nBody Synths\nMan I love acid.\nSyntonie\nVideo synth. Aye look that's me!\nHere are the other things that I played / tried out:\nWhile you're walking around, it's possible to run into some random-ass cook sessions like these:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nLastly, RIP theresyn.\nConcerts\nI was going to meet David but I got distracted by this kickass techno event in the middle of the forest.\nIt was Jessica Kert playing... it was an amazing set!\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nAfter that, I was really impressed by the huge setup at the stage:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nI can summarize my second day with this T-shirt I guess:\nDay 0x3\n(\nToday I'm heading to DIY Kit Day at Klunkerkranich!\nIt's where you can buy DIY kits and assemble them, listen to some live modular music and just hang out with audio folks at a nice rooftop!\nI bought and assembled an amazing kit there:\nIt's a VCO that produces a squeaky sound and is very fun to play with!\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nLook at the eyes!\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nAlso, got myself a fuzz pedal called Fur Face for assembling it when I get back home:\nBought the album of Keven from Zlob! I'm glad that there is a CD player in my car.\nAnd one really surprising thing happened... I got recognized.\nSome people approached me and said they were big fans of Ratatui...\nIt was nice to meet you Juan and Gustavo!\nLastly, we wrapped up the day with some amazing sets, most notably from Shakmat's founder's live set:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nOutro\nMy Berlin music adventure has ended. It was a very packed 3 days and it really felt like 3 weeks of learning new things!\nI'm very glad that I did this. My vision has definitely broadened, I had many ideas for my projects and most importantly met so many new people!\nAh, also I now have these modules:\nSo what's the plan going forward?\nI have been doing something called .\nThink of a crazy project idea.\nTurn that idea into a talk proposal for a conference (and get accepted).\nSpeedrun the development of the project.\nProfit (or crash and burn).\nThat's what I did with Ratzilla, see my talk at FOSDEM 2025. I think it's a great way to beat the comfort of delay and keep myself on the grind.\nAnd yes, I am doing again these days... but for a music-related project this time. I will start small with a learning tool for my guitar and then maybe I will build a full-fledged Eurorack or some kind of music production workspace in the future.\nI'm planning to livestream my whole journey and I'll start in the following weeks. So make sure you follow me on YouTube if you don't want to miss the new tunes &amp; TUIs!\nIf you liked this post, or anything that I'm building, gimme a sponsorship on GitHub :)\nSpecial thanks to David Runge for letting me know about the Superbooth!\nAs a beginner in the music sphere, I would appreciate any ideas or tips about starting out.\nAs always, you can leave your comments below!\nLove,\n~o","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/am-i-a-musician-yet/","title":"Am I a musician yet? - Superbooth 2025 Experience"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/automated-rust-releases/":{"body":"Here is how you can publish a Rust project with a single click of a button and automate everything.\nImagine a developer named nuhro. He wrote his first ever Rust program and it is happily running on his machine. He also sent a binary/exe to a couple of trusting friends and they all loved the program after blindly executing it. Good vibes!\nThen one day, he decided to share this small program with the world (AKA Reddit). For that, he realized he needed to release the program. Otherwise, how are the residents of the internet (who might be using different OSes/platforms) going to install/run the program, right?\nNo worries, there must be an easy way of releasing Rust crates and automating this stuff.\nhe thought.\nAnd yeah, this was me back in 2019 when I published my first Rust project and automated the release process with a snatched-off GitHub Actions workflow from ripgrep o_O\nComing back to today, if you want to release a Rust project, it is likely that you will come across the following Rust release tools:\ncargo-release: everything about releasing a rust crate.\ncargo-smart-release: release complex cargo-workspaces automatically with changelog generation.\ncargo-unleash: release automatisation tooling for massiv mono-repos.\nWe can list other tools here, but in a nutshell, all we want to do is:\nMake sure the project is in a state for the release. This might include updated version/changelog/dependencies.\nTag the new release.\nPublish the new version on the various platforms (crates.io, GitHub, etc.)\nQ: Okay okay, but aren't you overcomplicating things? I mean... just update the version in Cargo.toml and run cargo publish.\nA: That's fair, but how about binary releases? As someone who has spent a good amount of time automating NPM releases, I would say this might not be that easy for every project.\nQ: I still think you can just copy/paste a GitHub Actions workflow file from another project and adopt it.\nA: It is still too much manual work + release process is still not fully automated - you need to create tags/update changelog etc. Besides, your name is \"Q\" but you are not really asking questions anymore and just rambling. Maybe it is time to introduce you as a new character in these blog posts.\nQ: It do be like that sometimes.\nAnyhoo, it seems like we are going to end up all over the place if we were to over-plan the release process. I wish there was a more standardized way...\nIn fact, there is!\nThe Potent Elixir ✨\nHere, we are going to mix up the most powerful tools to come up with the witch's concoction, the ultimate way of publishing Rust crates. Some may call it the toxic brew that might poison one due to over-automation. Some may call it the one-way ticket to the automation hell. Some may--\n*ahem*\nSo here is the list of tools we are going to utilize:\nToolDescriptionFunction\ngit-cliffA highly customizable Changelog Generator.Automates the changelog generation.\nrelease-plzPublish Rust crates from CI with a Release PR.Handles dependency updates, version management, and crates.io release.\ncargo-distShippable application packaging for Rust.Creates GitHub releases and packaging for various platforms.\nDependabotAutomated dependency updates built into GitHub.Updates the Rust and GitHub Actions dependencies.\nMergifyAutomated CI/CD tool for optimization.Automatically merges the Dependabot pull requests.\nWith minimal tweaks, we can make these tools work seamlessly integrated with each other and at the end of the day what we have to do is just click a button to trigger a new release. In other words, the best part about this release flow is that almost everything is handled in the CI i.e. GitHub Actions thus we don't even move a finger.\nNow, let's get to work!\nSetting Things Up ⚙️\ngit-cliff\ngit-cliff is one of my big projects and it is widely used in the Rust ecosystem for automating the changelog generation.\ngit-cliff is a command-line tool (written in Rust) that provides a highly customizable way to generate changelogs from git history. It supports using custom regular expressions to alter changelogs which are mostly based on conventional commits. With a single configuration file, a wide variety of formats can be applied for a changelog, thanks to the Jinja2/Django-inspired template engine. More information and examples can be found in the GitHub repository.\nFor our changelog format, we can simply go with the default configuration which outputs something like the following:\nFor this configuration, first, we should install git-cliff:\nThen we can initialize it as follows:\nThis will create cliff.toml in the current directory and you can commit it in the root directory of your repo for release-plz to pick it up.\nIf you want to generate a fancier changelog, you can look at the examples or use the configuration that git-cliff uses which corresponds to the following:\nGreat, now we are ready to set up the actual releaser tool!\nrelease-plz\nrelease-plz creates a fully automated release pipeline, allowing you to easily release changes more frequently, without the fear of doing typos or other subtle manual mistakes you can make when releasing from your terminal.\nUnlike git-cliff, we don't actually need to install release-plz as a command-line tool. It is because release-plz runs from the CI (GitHub Actions) and we are not doing anything locally for the releases. However, we still need to tweak some things regarding how we want to release our project.\nFor configuring release-plz, create release-plz.toml with the following contents at the root of your repository:\nThe important options here are:\nchangelog_config: should point out to the git-cliff configuration we created in the previous section.\ndependencies_update: setting this to true means that you want to run cargo update before each release. Enabling this for updating the transitive dependencies wouldn't hurt since we will already be updating the main dependencies with Dependabot in future steps.\ngit_tag_enable: set this to true to create a tag for the new releases.\ngit_release_enable: make sure to set this to false since we don't want release-plz to create a GitHub release for us since that part will be handled by cargo-dist.\nAs for the next step, we should create the actual release automation that is responsible for running release-plz for each commit pushed to the repository and creating a \"release PR\".\nQ: A release PR?\nA: Release PR is a pull request that represents the next release and contains the necessary changes such as version bumps and changelog updates.\nhttps://github.com/orhun/daktilo/pull/51\nAfter you merge the release PR, release-plz detects that there is a version change in Cargo.toml and runs cargo publish to release the new version on crates.io.\nQ: Ah, so we probably need to set up secrets for the publish token, etc., right?\nYes! And a few permissions, too. You can check out release-plz documentation for more detailed information but here is a quick summary:\n1. Change \"Workflow permissions\" to allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests in Repository &gt; Settings &gt; Actions &gt; General.\n2. Create a new PAT (Personal Access Token) (either fine-grained or classic) with correct repository permissions and add it to the repository as a secret named RELEASE_PLZ_TOKEN.\n3. On crates.io, generate a new token with publish-new and publish-update permissions and add it to the repository as a secret named CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN.\n4. We can finally create our GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/release-plz.yml\nTo break it down:\nWe are cloning the entire git history with fetch-depth: 0, which is necessary to determine the next version and build the changelog.\nWe are installing Rust stable ('cause why not?!)\nAs the last step, we are running release-plz, heck yea!\nQ: Whoa whoa whoa hey hey hey, what's up with GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PLZ_TOKEN }}? Just use ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} bro, which is defined as default for each repository.\nA: Good question! If you use GITHUB_TOKEN then it means that you are going to authenticate on behalf of GitHub Actions.\nQ: So, what's wrong with that?\nA: Well, workflows that are triggered by on: push: tags won't run if the tag is created by GitHub Actions. So we are using a personal access token which is a way of saying \"Dear GitHub Actions, I am running release-plz and it is ME who is creating a tag so please run the further workflows\". Also, this way we don't need to specify workflow permissions via permissions: key. You can read more about it here.\nNow we are simply ready to work on our project as usual and release-plz will create a release PR for our changes and we can merge it to create a new release when we are ready!\nQ: What if I want to run/test release-plz locally though?\nA: You can if you want! The release PR is just the output of release-plz update command so you can run it locally and see what has changed in terms of changelog etc. Also, if you want to create a PR from the command-line you can simply run release-plz release-pr!\ncargo-dist\ncargo-dist makes distributing binaries easier by breaking the process down into multiple steps such as plan, build, publish and announce.\nIt is simply a tool for creating this beautiful release page along with binary artifacts and installers:\nhttps://github.com/orhun/daktilo/releases/tag/v0.4.0\nSimilar to release-plz, cargo-dist is a tool that we are not going to use locally but run from the CI instead. However, it is required to be installed to set up the CI (for itself) for the first time.\nSo let's start by installing cargo-dist:\nYou can also use cargo-dist-installer to install cargo-dist (i.e. the binary installer) if you wish:\nWe will also have an installer as shown above after cargo dist does its magic.\nQ: Magic?\nA: Yeah, this:\nQ: Woah, what happened?\nThe command above generates .github/workflows/release.yml file for handling the GitHub releases. Also, it adds the following section to your project's Cargo.toml:\nYou can update this configuration to easily configure cargo-dist and tweak your release settings.\nQ: What about new releases/breaking changes of cargo-dist? Do I need to remove the configuration and start over?\nA: You can simply run cargo dist init again to re-generate the release configuration!\nQ: Cool! Does cargo-dist check if the workflow file is up-to-date? What if I want to make changes to the generated GitHub Actions workflow (such as installing Linux dependencies)?\nA: Simply set the following values in the configuration to avoid an \"out of date\" warning:\nQ: How can I test cargo-dist locally?\nA: Easy:\nAnd run cargo dist build if you actually want to build the artifacts. Also, if you set pr-run-mode to upload in the configuration, then the artifacts will be built and uploaded as artifacts.zip to the related commit on GitHub.\nNow we are ready to build artifacts and release them on GitHub! There are a couple of steps left until we create a release and showcase everything.\nDependabot\nDependabot is a tool built into GitHub for automatically updating a project's dependencies via creating pull requests.\nWe can simply configure it by creating .github/dependabot.yml:\nNow Dependabot will start creating pull requests for Rust/GitHub Actions dependencies when they become out-of-date:\nhttps://github.com/orhun/systeroid/pull/141\nMergify\nMergify is a CI/CD pipeline optimizer that manages your pull request, automates your GitHub workflow, and optimizes your CI costs.\nWe will be using Mergify to:\nAutomatically merge Dependabot pull requests.\nUpdate to the latest main branch for pull requests.\nLet's create the configuration in .github/mergify.yml:\nThen, we need to create an account on https://mergify.com, setup GitHub integration (Integrations &gt; GitHub &gt; Configure) and add our repository:\nLastly, we need to enforce a GitHub repository branch protection rule by enabling Require status checks to pass and adding a check for Mergify Merge Protections (see the Mergify documentation).\nNow Mergify will start to process the open pull requests:\nThe Dependabot pull requests are now merged automatically! 🎉\nLet's Create Releases 🚀\nAll the code/configuration is available here: https://github.com/orhun/automated-rust-releases\nrelease-plz already created a PR for us:\nhttps://github.com/orhun/automated-rust-releases/pull/1\ncargo-dist checks also pass. Let's click merge and create a release:\nAfter the merge, release-plz picks up the new version from Cargo.toml and pushes the new version to crates.io:\nrelease-plz also creates a new tag which triggers cargo-dist:\ncargo-dist builds the artifacts and uploads them to the GitHub release:\nhttps://github.com/orhun/automated-rust-releases/releases/tag/v0.1.1\nAs you can see cargo-dist also parses the changelog (which is generated by git-cliff) and adds it to the release. (Please note that you actually need to create CHANGELOG.md file at the root of your repository for this to work.)\nLet's try out the installer for the heck of it:\nAnd when we run it:\nBeautiful!\nConclusion 🤔\nI used this release automation for my latest project daktilo (a CLI program to turn your keyboard into a typewriter) and I'm pretty satisfied with it so far. The only thing I'm waiting for is the following improvements:\ngit-cliff: better GitHub integration (i.e. adding contributor names to the changelogs *)\nrelease-plz: setting the version in the release PR with a command *\ncargo-dist: cross compilation *\nLet me know if you have suggestions and ideas!\nHappy releasing! 🦀\nhoudoe!\n💖 Liked this article?

In this post, I will be talking about its features and telling the story behind how I deployed it to shuttle.rs to make it publicly available for free use.\nIf the Sun is warm, the winds are favorable, and it’s the right time of year, you could use butterflies to send someone the entire internet.*\nIf you have chatted with me on the internet before and if I wanted to share an image/link with you, it is highly likely that I might have sent you a message like this:\nThe first time people get this, they either find it interesting and ask about or they just roll with it and click the link. Most of the time, it is the latter.\nIf you have ever wondered why I prefer sending links instead of directly sending the image/file and what's behind that, you are lucky. Today is the day that I will finally reveal this mystery.\nBuckle up!\nThe Story of File Sharing\nTo properly convey the idea behind file sharing, I need to tell you a story.\nIn the early days of the internet (not that I lived through them), communication was simpler and naturally less secure. One of the things people have used was the almighty Internet Relay Chat (IRC), the famous chat system that is being used even today by some projects. Back in the day, people were creating channels there and enjoying the non-secure, less-censored, and kind-of-anonymous communication. Today, those times are considered the golden era of the internet by some people including me. Everything was so peaceful and you could smell the dusty air which is coming from an old PC fan that is hardly running Windows XP with an Intel Pentium 4 processor. *sigh* Happy times.\nWell, no.\nYou couldn't share images on IRC. At least it wasn't that easy since IRC clients were heavily text-based and designed to be run on a terminal (the author is talking about BitchX here). Surely, it wasn't as easy and as convenient as today's chatting applications and we can't expect it to be. But I think it is still Cheff's KISS, what even is file-sharing support anyways? It requires storing the files somewhere and serving them to the recipient. There are so many things to consider such as upload limits, nude detection (if you care about it), privacy, persistence of the files, additional server costs, disk spaces, etc. Long story short, file sharing is BLOAT! Describing to my friends how to craft a chainmail armor in Minecraft with purely plain-text messages instead of sending a screenshot is much BETTER. Or wait, we can use ASCII art, oh yeah, that's also a thing. Right?\n*ahem* I guess I went a bit off-track there. But you see where I'm getting, on IRC, there was no easy file sharing support so people had to come up with their own solutions, in other words, their own upload servers. In my time in IRC, I came across a lot of users who use links like the below, just to share files/images:\nhttps://paste.xinu.at/jHKy\nhttps://0x0.st/H8hSa.png\nIn a sense, in today's world, doing this seems redundant and actually more difficult than just clicking 3 buttons on an interface. While I agree with that, I approach this situation from a different angle.\nTechnology is all about having control. I believe it is especially true today since every corner of the human brain is easily conquerable by technology. We are deeply integrated with this world and in the situation where we don't control it, it controls us. Cliché but true.\nIn the case of file sharing, having your own (self-hosted) service for uploading your own files is simply having control over what you have provided to this virtual world. The thing that you want to share is there if you want it, and it is there under the circumstances that you have chosen. Maybe the files will be served from an external drive from your homeserver. Maybe they will be expiring after 2 hours. Maybe you want to see who has clicked the link. It is all about owning your data.\nWhen you consider these points, you see that the insufficient conditions from the IRC times revealed a perfect solution for file sharing which compliments the idea that centralization is bad. It is kind of ironic that IRC's limitations gave birth to self-hosted file sharing.\nAlthough I joined IRC pretty late (3 years ago), I got the hang of it pretty fast. At first, I used a couple of public services for sharing files but then I really warmed up to the self-hosting idea and decided to host my own upload server. That is why I wrote the \"Spin Up Your Own No-Bullshit File Hosting Service with 0x0\" post 2 years ago. I used 0x0 for a while but then I had to migrate to another server and I was too lazy to set it up again. Plus it was written in Python x_x.\nThat day I decided to write my own pastebin service. And of course, I was going to write it in Rust.\nBlazingly Fast File Sharing: rustypaste 🦀\n⭐ GitHub: https://github.com/orhun/rustypaste\n🚀 Public instance: https://rustypaste.shuttleapp.rs\nrustypaste is a minimal and simple upload service written in Rust and implemented using the Actix Web framework. I chose Actix back then since it was the most suitable framework from the safety, performance, and simplicity standpoint. As a regular user of rustypaste for almost 2 years, I can say that it is in a stable state and have a bunch of features that support extensive configuration.\nThe easiest way to interact with a rustypaste server is using curl but you can also use the command line tool called rpaste which is written in Rust.\n⭐ CLI tool: https://github.com/orhun/rustypaste-cli\nHere is a list of features along with examples:\nUpload a file\ncurl -F \"file=@ferris.txt\" https://rustypaste.shuttleapp.rs\nrpaste ferris.txt\nShorten an URL\ncurl -F \"url=https://example.com/some/long/url\" https://rustypaste.shuttleapp.rs\nrpaste -u https://example.com/some/long/url\nUpload a file from URL\ncurl -F \"remote=https://example.com/file.png\" https://rustypaste.shuttleapp.rs\nrpaste -r https://example.com/file.png\nExpire the file after 10 minutes (also works for URLs)\ncurl -F \"file=@ferris.txt\" -H \"expire:10min\" https://rustypaste.shuttleapp.rs\nrpaste -e 10min ferris.txt\nDelete the file after viewed once\ncurl -F \"oneshot=@ferris.txt\" https://rustypaste.shuttleapp.rs\nrpaste -o ferris.txt\nAuthenticate with the server\ncurl -F \"file=@ferris.txt\" -H \"Authorization: &lt;auth_token&gt;\" https://rustypaste.shuttleapp.rs\nrpaste -a \"&lt;auth_token&gt;\" ferris.txt (you can also use a configuration file)\nTo configure rustypaste, you only need a single configuration file. The default one can be viewed from the GitHub repository (config.toml).\nHere are some things that you can tweak and change:\nRandom file names\nPet name (capital-mosquito.txt)\nAlphanumeric string (yB84D2Dv.txt)\nMIME types\nSupports overriding and blacklisting\nSupports forcing to download via ?download=true\nSupport disabling duplicate uploads\nAuto-expiration + auto-deletion of files\nIf you want to host your own rustypaste server, there are a couple of ways of doing it:\nRun the single binary (preferably installed from your distribution's package manager).\nrustypaste is available in the Arch Linux repositories.\nUse the lightweight Docker image.\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/orhunp/rustypaste\ndocker-compose.yml (example)\nNginx configuration (example)\nOr you can deploy it to the cloud! ☁️\nDeploying Rust Services via Shuttle 🚀\nShuttle is a Rust-native cloud development platform that lets you deploy your app while also taking care of all of your infrastructure.\nShuttle derives the infrastructure definitions from the Rust code itself via function signatures and annotations. It is an awesome service that makes cloud deployment super easy and supports a couple of Rust frameworks including Actix. Also, you can control everything (deployment, monitoring, resource management, etc.) with a single cargo subcommand by running cargo shuttle from the command line. When you consider all of this, there is no wonder that they are backed by YC :o\nCurrently, they support a hobby plan which is basically free and you can reach out to them if the following features are not suitable/enough for you:\nUnlimited deployment\n150k requests per month\n500MB database storage\nThat is pretty much enough for rustypaste so I decided to go with Shuttle. 🚀\nHowever, there was one question that came up to my mind about the storage space. So I asked a question on their Discord:\norhun: How does Shuttle deployment store files? Internally, are they uploaded inside an isolated container? If so, is there any disk/memory/CPU limits?\njonaro00: Your project runs in a docker container, but writing to the file system is not recommended, since the container is wiped when you do cargo shuttle project restart (which you do when upgrading shuttle version, or when things break). For persistent storage, you want to use some form of database. You can check the supported ones on the docs, but there are also more of them in the works.\norhun: I'm planning to auto-expire the files after one hour or so would you recommend using the filesystem in this case?\njonaro00: Yeah, for that use case it works fine then I guess.\nStill, I'm not sure if there are any disk space limits for a Shuttle deployment and we couldn't figure it out on Discord so let me know if you know anything about this.\nNow that we have enough information about Shuttle, let's deploy a Rust project!\nStart by installing cargo-shuttle and logging in:\nAfter this step, you can simply create a Rust project ready for deployment. For creating an Actix template, we can run:\nAs of now, cargo-shuttle supports the following templates: actix-web, axum, poem, poise, rocket, salvo, serenity, tide, thruster, tower, warp\nAfter the creation, the project looks roughly like this:\nTo test it locally:\nFor deployment, it is just easy as running the following command:\nThen you can view the deployment at &lt;app&gt;.shuttleapp.rs and view the logs via cargo shuttle logs.\nIn the case of rustypaste, I already have an Actix application so I need to tweak things a little bit for deployment. Mainly, I needed to change the main entry point of the application. I decided to have a feature flag called \"shuttle\" for wrapping the additional dependencies of Shuttle and enabling another entry point. I didn't touch the rest of the code and it feels absolutely awesome when there is less effort.\nShuttle can be activated via --features shuttle now.\nThen I hit another road block.\nYou see, rustypaste needs a config.toml file to be present to run. And when we deploy it as a single binary, there won't be a configuration file next to it. To solve this problem, I used a static folder for my Shuttle deployment and edited the entry point of the application as follows:\nSo if I put the configuration file in \"shuttle/config.toml\", it will be the part of the deployment. Nice.\nAll seems good now. Let's deploy it!\nQ: Wait, how do you enable the custom \"shuttle\" feature via cargo shuttle? In other words, can you pass --features shuttle to it?\nA: At the time of writing this blog post, it is not possible. So I created this issue: https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/913\nQ: Oh cool, is there a workaround?\nA: Yeah, I decided to enable \"shuttle\" feature as default in Cargo.toml temporarily when I want to deploy.\nQ: Nice. Does it work like that?\nA: You bet!\nYay, the service is live at https://rustypaste.shuttleapp.rs! 🚀\nAs a bonus, I wanted to deploy this service when I push a new tag to the repository so I created the following GitHub Actions workflow:\nOne thing to note, I thought it would be nicer to install cargo-shuttle via cargo-binstall since it is faster to download pre-built binaries.\nAnd finally here is how I put together everything:\nhttps://github.com/orhun/rustypaste/commit/29ddef8\nConclusion\nThere are a lot of ways to share a file on the internet and I'm on the \"you should host your own files\" side. At first, it seems like a hassle to host your own server and configure everything but I believe it is really worth it at the end of the day. I mean heck, with rustypaste you can even share a very secret document as a oneshot URL so they disappear from the surface of the web after being viewed once.\nAnd also, who can deny that using your own domain to share an image/file is super cool?\nLong story short, I believe there are many benefits to self-hosting an upload server and owning the things you share with the rest of the world.\nOn a side note, feel free to use the public instance of rustypaste and let me know if you liked it, there isn't a stability guarantee for Shuttle deployments but it is worth a try!\nHappy uploading! ☁️ 🦀 🚀\narrivederci!","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/blazingly-fast-file-sharing/","title":"Taking Rust to the Cloud: Blazingly Fast File Sharing"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/cant-trust-any-vpn/":{"body":"After Turkey banned Discord, I had to jump through some hoops, fix my VPN, and learn a bit about how DNS works.\nOn October 9th 2024, Discord was banned in Turkey due to various criminal allegations.\nThis was an ongoing issue and Discord apparently refused to share user data (IP addresses and content) thus the government decided to block the whole thing altogether. I'm not here to talk about if this was the right thing to do or not or to drag you into politics, so feel free to read around the internet if you're interested.\nToday I'm here to share what I have learned while trying to... you know. Find a way to use Discord again. Surprisingly, this ban ended up being a positive experience for me.\nI hope the officials are ̶n̶o̶t̶ reading this.\nTimeline\nIn the early morning hours of the day that our beloved platform, Discord, got its ass whooped, I was actually at the airport heading to Vienna for the EuroRust conference. Before my flight, I tried checking my messages to see if there was anything new - to my surprise, I was greeted with this:\nIn other words:\nI thought:\nAh, maybe the airport Wi-Fi is acting up. But wait... I'm already connected to the VPN. 🤔\nSo I tried using the Discord app on my phone and it worked as usual. Later on, I saw the news when I did a quick research but I didn't think much about it because I had a flight and a conference ahead. I could always look into it when I'm back home, right? After all, I had a VPN, so it should be fine, right???\nWell, I came home last night and realized I can't use Discord at all, even with a VPN.\nThat's why I'm writing this blog post in the morning.\nPain.\nVPN Setup\nNot sponsored!\nYou might be asking, \"Hey Orhun, VPNs should work out of the box, what kind of a shitty setup do you have?\" and you are absolutely right.\nI have my own VPN (😎) - in other uncool words, I set up OpenVPN on a VPS and I have been using it for a while without any issues.\nWow, setting that up must be a lot of work!\nNo. In fact, I just ran the openvpn-install script to set everything up:\nThis gives you a configuration file such as client.ovpn which contains your server address, port and certificates and you can simply run this command to connect to the VPN on Linux:\nI use the Android app as well and everything works like a charm! At least that's what I thought until this blog post...\nHere is the relevant part of my VPN configuration:\nThis is a vanilla configuration so I'm mostly using the defaults. See the reference manual for detailed information about these values.\nDebugging\nThe most mind-boggling part of the problem for me was that I was able to use Discord via OpenVPN on my phone but not on my computer. Whenever I try to launch the desktop app, it gets stuck at the loading screen with the error message I shared above. To limit the scope of the problem, I also tried the website app directly, which resulted in the certificate error.\nHow does Discord know that I'm still in Turkey!?\nI searched around the internet and found out that nearly all the website restrictions in Turkey are done on the DNS level. I quickly brought out trippy from my terminal toolbox to check the network hops that are happening while I'm connecting to Discord:\nI hope I'm not doxxing myself with that image. Maybe I'm just *tripping*...\nSo from 9th hop to 11th, I can see that I am connecting to my OpenVPN server in Frankfurt. But after the 12th hop, it goes back to the Turkey DNS.\nWhat? What's the point of the VPN then lmao\nOkay, at that point I was clueless. I tried changing the DNS settings of OpenVPN (i.e. dhcp-option DNS 1.1.1.1) but it didn't work. After a couple of iterations with ChatGPT, it finally led me to the correct path.\nIt turns out, my DNS was leaking.\nThe DNS leak is a security flaw that allows your DNS requests to be revealed to your ISP, and anyone else who might be snooping on the network.\nI discovered a website called DNSLeakTest which you can use to check that:\nSheesh dats indeed leakin'\nSo I was using my ISP's DNS instead of the VPN's DNS the whole time.\nUsing this VPN was just pointless. 💀\nSolution\nRemember these lines from my config above?\nUsing block-outside-dns is also suggested by DNSLeakTest and it sounds like the correct option:\nBlock DNS servers on other network adapters to prevent DNS leaks.\nThis option prevents any application from accessing TCP or UDP port 53 except one inside the tunnel.\nWell then, what's the problem?\nIt uses Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) and works on Windows Vista or later.\nBruh... Windows Vista mentioned tho o7\nI'm on Arch Linux btw - and it has a very detailed wiki about OpenVPN, as always. It wasn't very hard to find the exact thing I needed, it's right there under the DNS section.\nIn a nutshell:\nThe DNS changes are not automatically applied by the OpenVPN client on Linux.\nYou need to configure up and down scripts for managing the DNS updates.\nThe recommended script is update-resolv-conf, which modifies DNS settings when the VPN connects and restores them upon disconnection.\nThat script consists of a bunch of arcane bash commands that I don't understand.\nSo how is any of that relevant to DNS leaking?\nWhen the DNS changes aren't automatically applied when connecting to the VPN, the system will continue to use the default DNS settings thus your ISP's DNS. 💀\nSo the solution for me was to firstly install the following packages:\nThen add the following lines to the OpenVPN configuration:\nAnd run the VPN as usual:\nBoom, no more leaks!\nIt goes through Frankfurt as expected!\nAnd I can use Discord again! 🎉\nExtras\ndnsleaktest-tui\nSince I'm a big fan of terminal tools, I wrote a small proof-of-concept TUI using Rust/Ratatui to check if my DNS is leaking. I also added a small traceroute feature to see the network hops.\nHere is how it looks like without VPN:\nAnd most importantly, I can observe that my DNS is leaking while I'm connected to the VPN:\nThe code is based on dnsleaktest and I used trippy as a library.\n⭐ Here is the repository: https://github.com/orhun/dnsleaktest-tui\ni3 integration\nI don't like running this command every time I want to connect to the VPN:\nSo I wanted to add a keybinding to my i3 configuration to enable/disable the VPN and show a notification on the status bar when it's connected/disconnected.\nSo...\nI switched to a systemd service to manage the VPN.\nI created a simple script to start/stop the service.\nI added a keybinding to my i3 configuration to run the script via pkexec (since it requires root privileges).\nI installed lxsession-gtk3 package as the authentication agent.\nI updated my i3status configuration to show the VPN status.\n⭐ Here is how I implemented it.\nAt the end of the day, I just press Super + Shift + V to connect/disconnect:\nAnd I can see the status (\"V: UP\")\nCheers!","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/cant-trust-any-vpn/","title":"Can't trust any VPN these days"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/fosdem-2024-experience/":{"body":"Sharing my experience after giving a talk at FOSDEM 2024!\nThe Venue 🏛️\nFOSDEM takes place in Brussels, Belgium in the ULB Solbosch Campus.

It's also known as \"GPG\", which is the name of the command line tool that makes it easier to integrate with other applications. It is battle-tested over the years and has a wealth of frontend applications and libraries.\nMy past with GnuPG is roughly the same with an ordinary developer who is into programming, open source, and related concepts. So I cannot say that I was using it for more than encryption/decryption/verification of files/emails and different types of authentication. It is a tool basically for securing the communication for me.\nBut some things about gpg, the CLI tool, were bugging me. I remember times that I have to run multiple commands to get fully informed about a key. Or I have to process its output to get the information that I needed. (using grep, sed, etc.) Not to mention that some of the output of gpg is quite confusing if you're unfamiliar with the GnuPG terms. So for years, I was thinking that it'd be nice to have a more user-friendly and interactive tool to handle the tasks that gpg is trying to accomplish. These tasks include key management operations such as listing (showing subkeys, user ids, signatures), signing, deleting keys, etc.\nPlan\nSo I decided to write this tool in Rust, using tui-rs and bindings for the GPGME library.\nGPGME uses GnuPG's OpenPGP backend as default to provide a high-level crypto API for various operations including key management, which was the thing I needed. And I have written a TUI program using tui-rs before, so why not use it again?\nImplementation\nI'd like to point out the 2 main issues that I've dealt with during the development process.\nListing Format\nI started with the very basic: listing keys. Thankfully GPGME had an example for it, so it was supposed to be easy to implement.\nOutput from GPGME example:\nTa-da! It's done.\nWell, no. It was good and well until I reached the point where I realized I should come up with my own listing format. If I use this format or the format that gpg -k uses, I'm afraid I can't extend it for my needs. So I played around with different formats a little bit and found an optimal one that can expand/shrink to show more/fewer details about an individual key. It consists of two columns which are key information and user information:\nThanks to tree-like output, everything was clearer and it was possible to show more detail without worrying about making the output look complicated.\nHere's the gpg -k output of the same key:\nI explain this custom format in detail in the project's documentation.\nAfter figuring out the format that I think the most suitable for the key listing, I made it possible to toggle the detail level that list entries shows by assigning a key to it. So it will be not only possible to interactively select/scroll these keys, the user was also supposed to be able to see the other user ids and signatures if they want. That was a plus one.\nGPG Fallback\nMy next step was figuring out which operations that I wanted to support. I knew that gpg manpage had a section called \"How to manage your keys\", so I decided to go along with it. The plan is to support all of these features, with the extensions/flexibility that having a TUI provides.\nAfter implementing a couple of those features using GPGME, I realized it was not possible to do it all due to various reasons.\nwell, whatever.\nI thought I can get help from gpg for these cases. It's already a powerful tool, so why not use it instead of designing custom tabs/widgets/layouts for each feature? I can pause the TUI during the execution of a gpg command and resume it afterward. Seems like a good idea.\nSo I did. And I'm pretty happy with the result. Until I decide to extend the TUI for these operations, I think it's better to get help from 3-4 external gpg commands.\n\"GPG on steroids\"\nAnd so my journey continued and I implemented the commonly used gpg operations for my interface. I also added some extra features to use the real power of having a TUI. And since I'm designing a TUI for GPG, I named the project gpg-tui. Just simple.\nHere's the end result:\nAs of the initial release, gpg-tui can do the following:\nList keys\nExport keys\nSign keys\nEdit keys\nImport/receive keys\nSend keys\nGenerate keys\nDelete keys\nRefresh keys\nWith lots of additional TUI features like copy/paste mode, options menu, and command prompt!\nSee README.md for more information.\nEndnote\nMy goal for the next releases is to implement new features that will make key management even easier. I wish a project that is born solely from my needs will also be useful for other people.\nHomepage of gpg-tui (GitHub)\nMy GitHub profile (@orhun, check out my other projects!)\nFollow me on Twitter (@orhundev)\nFollow gpg-tui on Twitter (@gpg_tui, for latest updates)\nAlso if you liked gpg-tui and/or my other projects, consider consider supporting me on GitHub Sponsors or Patreon.\n(I recently got my first ever patron so I'd like to thank Ethem for their nice surprise and support :D)\nHave a good day!","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/introducing-gpg-tui/","title":"Introducing gpg-tui, a Terminal User Interface for GnuPG"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/introducing-kmon/":{"body":"Introducing kmon, a Linux kernel manager and activity monitor 🐧💻\nUnfortunately, it's common to use a technology without knowing the inner workings of it. However, having a good grasp on the specific details of it might help with various situations like fixing a bug or adding new features to it. Especially if you're a developer/engineer.\nI've been using GNU/Linux for years and I really love the uniqueness and simplicity that some distributions provide. It also provides a close to perfect development environment in my opinion, if you customize it.\nBut one of the things, probably the most important thing, that I neglected to learn its details was the Linux kernel. I was using various tools for adding a module to the Linux kernel to make a program work (like VirtualBox) or I was disabling modules to change the purpose of a hardware. But I've never into the Linux kernel really. It was just being updated regularly and sitting there, waiting to be explored.\nMy previous experiences taught me that the best way of learning something is creating a project that solves a problem depending on your needs. Also adding some flavors (like using a tech stack that you've not used before) will increase the chance of drowning inside the \"ocean of the new stuff\". Which is a good thing because it will force you to swim back to the surface. In the context of the project, it will force you to make the project as perfect as possible and finish it. Because as everyone knows, it's always easier to abandon a project.\nSo I've decided to learn the basics of the Linux kernel including kernel types and its history. It was surely a good idea in order to understand the \"core\" element of the systems we're using today. And then I created my first Linux kernel module that only prints a message when it's loaded and unloaded. It looked like legacy tools like dmesg, kmod and modprobe are preferred most of the time for Linux kernel management on command line. So I've loaded my example kernel module with modprobe and retrieved the log messages with dmesg. Even though I've checked for other alternative tools, I didn't come across a tool that you can do these operations together at the same time.\nTherefore I thought that I should write that tool in a memory-efficient and fast programming language. Rust!\ntui-rs is a Rust library for creating text-based user interfaces with different backend options. I've chosen termion for the tool that I'm going to write. But still, one thing was missing. I should find a name for it to keep myself motivated while writing it.\nIt should be called... Hm... Kernel top? ktop... Nah, it's taken. How about kernel monitor? kmon... A-ha! Come on!\nActually, I've never written something in Rust before kmon. So it was an adventurous journey about the Linux kernel and Rust. I have to say that Rust has a nice development environment and efficient tools like rustfmt and clippy. And writing a Rust application about the Linux kernel on an Arch Linux system... It's not something that you can explain with words.\nOh what happened at the end of this journey? Well, let me show:\nYou can:\nsee the information of a module\nsearch a module\nload/unload a module\nblacklist a module\nand do other cool things\nin the text-based interface of kmon.\nHere's some examples:\nNavigating &amp; Scrolling\nArrow keys are used for navigating between blocks and scrolling.\nSearching a module\nSwitch to the search area with arrow keys or using one of the /, s, enter and provide a search query for the module name.\nLoading a module\nFor adding a module to the Linux kernel, switch to load mode with one of the +, i, insert keys and provide the name of the module to load. Then confirm/cancel the execution of the load command with y/n.\nThe command that used for loading a module:\nUnloading a module\nUse one of the -, u, backspace keys to remove the selected module from the Linux kernel.\nThe command that used for removing a module:\nBlacklisting a module\nBlacklisting is a mechanism to prevent the kernel module from loading. To blacklist the selected module, use one of the x, b, delete keys and confirm the execution.\nThe command that used for blacklisting a module:\n...\nkmon aims to be a standard tool for Linux kernel management while supporting most of the Linux distributions.

Let's manage the Linux kernel modules!"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/introducing-runst/":{"body":"runst is a dead simple notification daemon 🦡 In this post, I'm introducing the project and giving different usage examples that will improve your Linux desktop experience.\nhttps://github.com/orhun/runst\nNotifications\nIt is undeniable that notifications became an inescapable part of our overly techy lives in the past decade. Most of the time, it is overlooked how a simple alert dialog can fire different synapses in the human brain and let us feel a certain way. It is truly magnificent that we commonly don't see the fact that \"notifying\" is a form of communication and it is deeply integrated into our lives at this point.\nSo let's talk about Linux desktop and how we can handle notifications.\nWhat? I hear you say \"What the hell was that intro?\". Well, just stay tight. It was definitely not a trick to hook you to read this blog post.\nAs in every interactive system, GNU/Linux also has different ways of handling notifications. First, let's try to understand what a notification is and what we need to actually work with it.\nDesktop notifications are small, passive popup dialogs that notify the user of particular events in an asynchronous manner.\nIn other words, notifications are dialogs that are either shown on the screen for a certain amount of time and disappear or persist until user interaction. Cool!\nD-Bus\nNow, how do we interact with notifications? We clearly need some kind of internal communication protocol between processes to handle messages from different applications. Today, most Linux desktops depend on D-Bus for that purpose.\nD-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a \"single instance\" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.\nD-Bus has Desktop Notifications Specification which defines the standard implementation details for notification-related applications. On the other hand, libnotify is widely used for sending desktop notifications to a \"notification daemon\". Every system needs a running notification daemon for handling notifications.\nIf you are running D-Bus, you can create a desktop notification using the notify-send(1) command of libnotify:\nAnd you can query the desktop notifications real-time with running dbus-monitor(1):\nThis will result in:\nWith these in mind, let's take a look at different notification daemon implementations.\nNotification Daemons\nDesktop environments have a built-in feature for handling the notifications:\nCinnamon, Deepin, Enlightenment, GNOME, GNOME Flashback and KDE Plasma use their own implementations to display notifications, and they cannot be replaced. Their notification servers are started automatically on login to receive notifications from applications via D-Bus.\nIn that case, if we want to use a custom notification daemon, we need something standalone. This means they might require a manual setup to work with Xorg/Wayland. Here are a few projects:\nwired - Lightweight notification daemon with highly customizable layout blocks.\nmako - Lightweight notification daemon for Wayland.\ndunst - Lightweight and customizable notification daemon.\n(Editor's note: wow, they are all lightweight!)\nAmong those projects, by far the most popular notification daemon is dunst. Needless to say, I WAS a user of dunst. Also, the reason why I wrote runst is basically... dunst.\nSo, what is runst?\nrunst - a dead simple notification daemon 🦡\nrunst is yet another notification daemon implementation in Rust. It aims to be as simple as possible while providing customizable features. The reason why I wrote runst is simply that:\nI have been a user of dunst for a long time. However, they made some uncool breaking changes in v1.7.0 and it completely broke my configuration. That day, I refused to update dunst (I was too lazy to re-configure) and decided to write my own notification server using Rust.\nHence the name. (dunst + rust = runst)\nrunst is initially designed to show a simple notification window. On top of that, it combines customization-oriented and semi-innovative features. The way that I use runst is pretty simple, it's just an overlay on top of i3status bar:\nHowever, there are many cool things that you can do with runst.\nLet's go through its features with usage examples.\n(runst is configured with a single configuration file. You can check out the defaults here.)\nCustom window\nYou can customize the notification popup text, color and dimensions. For example:\nIn the configuration above, we configured the notification window dimensions, colors (for the normal urgency), font, and the message template.\nNow let's take a closer look at the template:\nrunst uses the following context for the template variables:\nSo we will end up with notifications like this:\n[runst] example this is a notification 🦡\n(default)\n[runst] example this is a notification 🦡 (3m 2s ago)\n(while viewing an old notification)\n[runst] example this is a notification 🦡 (2)\n(when there are 2 more unread notifications)\n[runst] example\n(if there is no body)\nWith this Tera-powered template, you can customize the notification text as you like.\nCustom commands\nYou can run custom OS commands based on urgency levels and the notification contents.\nImagine you want to perform a task when you receive a critical notification from a specific application:\nOr maybe you simply want to play a custom notification sound:\nOr maybe you want a Gotify notification on your different devices when someone says hi in any chatting application matched by the regex:\nSee more examples here.\nAuto clear\nNormally, if you want the notifications to disappear after e.g. 3 seconds, you can do this:\nIf the timeout is not specified by the sender, the low urgency notifications will be closed after 3 seconds. You can set timeout to 0 for unexpiring notifications.\nOn the other hand, if you want the notifications to disappear as you finish reading them, you can use the following option:\nIf this option is set to true, the estimated read time of the notification contents is calculated and it is used as the timeout for closing the notification. So if it takes 5 seconds to read the notification, it will disappear after 5 seconds.\nEndnote\nThere are other features that are not mentioned in this post so definitely check out the project's home page: https://github.com/orhun/runst\nI'm using runst daily and adding new features as new ideas rush through my mind so feedback is very welcome! It is still a bit barebone :&gt;\nSee you in the next project! 🦡","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/introducing-runst/","title":"Introducing runst: Handle desktop notifications neatly on Linux!"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/livestreaming/":{"body":"Some thoughts on why I started livestreaming my open-source development sessions and my future plans.\n🦀 TL;DR: Follow me on , where I regularly live-code in Rust, dive into open source, packaging stuff, share tips, and overall have some good ol' techy time.\n▶️ See my past live streams here.\nThis might be one of the unavoidable side quests if you are trying to tenaciously make a living from working on (and only on) open source. More than a year ago I wrote a blog post detailing my motivation for the things I have been doing and having a \"grindset\".\nToday, things have changed a bit, due to the fact that I eventually realized that writing code in a dark room is not enough if you want to make a name for yourself. You should also make sure that people know you and your work. This is where that you need to switch to an influencer-like mindset and do things like be active in communities, write blog posts, give talks, and so on.\nAnd as you might have guessed, I recently added to this list.\nHow it all started? 🌱\nIt was a mildly warm summer evening, I was sitting in front of my computer (as I always do) and doomscrolling through social media hoping not to max out my brainrot levels. Sometimes I don't feel like working on anything so unfortunately at times like these I find myself taking part in this highly unproductive activity. It happens way less than it used to be but still, it happens.\nThen I started thinking, I actually enjoy working on open source projects and write Rust code. Where does this boredom come from? Maybe I'm just burnt out? Everyone needs a break, right? ...right?\nNo, the grind MUST continue. I needed to somehow make programming fun for myself again. And then it hit me, \"for myself\"? Maybe I was too self-centric. I was sure that I shouldn't be the only one who feels this way from time to time. There must be a way to collectively enjoy programming and open source again while giving back to the community while sharing insights in an interactive way. And that's when I decided to start livestreaming.\nTaking the first step was a bit intimidating. After all, there are a lot of questions, like \"how should I talk to the camera?\", \"what if no one watches?\", \"what if my router catches on fire and I lose connection?\" and so on.\nBut then on a Sunday evening, I pretty much said 🇫 it and went live. And got hooked!\nHow is it going? ⏩\nOnce you got the hang of it, it feels like you are coding with a friend.\nOr you feel this way because not a lot of people are watching heh-\nMy friends always watch my streams.\nYou have friends?\nShut up, you goddamn rabbit!\nThe best part of livestreaming for me is the interactivity, it's like you are pair programming with some people. This means that you might need to walk through your thought process and explain what you are doing. And there are moments where you catch yourself doing something wrong because of it. It's a great way to learn and teach at the same time.\nAlso, for the longest time I remember, I had moments where I do something cool and wished that somebody was watching.\n\"finally, I got this working!\" \\o/\n2 seconds later\n\"aight back to work\"\nNow I capture those moments during live and there are at least some people who also share the excitement. Feels great!\nAnother aspect of it is you are simply sharing the behind-the-scenes content for people which I think is very useful in terms of sharing knowledge otherwise would be impossible to obtain. Doing this helps the people who would like to contribute to open source but do not know where to start. Or maybe they have an impostor syndrome and they think we are doing something magical whereas it just pressing keys on a keyboard and hoping for the best.\nAt the end of the day, it all boils down to engaging more with your community, and boy, it's fun.\nWhat's next? ✨\nAs a next step I'm planning to do more of this, and also try to make it more structured. I don't want to lose the hey guys so we're just freestyling today spirit but having a plan is always good. As of now, I'm planning to run the following series:\n1️⃣ : This is the series where I simply work on a Rust project and explain what I'm doing. It can be my own project, something that I maintain or something entirely new that I want to dive into.\nBuilding TUIs with Ratatui might be really interesting.\nI also want to pick a project and try to contribute to it live.\nAnd maybe we pick something from the chat sometimes and just go with it together.\n2️⃣ : As you may or may not know, I also do packaging for Linux distributions (such as Alpine and Arch Linux btw). In this series, I want to show how I maintain packages, how I update them, how I deal with issues, and so on.\nI can show how I package Rust tools for Arch Linux and how the build system works.\nIf there is any other maintenance work that I need to do (such as reviewing PRs, triaging issues), I will also do it in this series.\n3️⃣ : This is the series where I do whatever I want. It can be a Q&amp;A session, a review of a project, or maybe just a chill session where I code something that I want to code.\nI can have a guest on the stream and we can talk about a specific topic. (hint: podcast soon?)\nConclusion 🏁\nI have learned many things during my short career of livestreaming and I'm still pretty new to this. I would appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or ideas that you might have.\nHere are some things that I wanted to pinpoint from my experience:\nIt's better to have a few people watching and engaging rather than having a lot of people watching and not engaging.\nIt's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to not know something. You are not a robot.\nAlways remember to stop the stream on YouTube interface when you are done. Otherwise people might think you are writing Rust for 12 hours straight... which is a rookie level.\nLivestreaming is essentially a gateway to producing more video content, and I have many ideas. We will see what the future will bring :)\n⬇️ Links:\n🔗 YouTube Channel\n🔗 Past Live Streams\n🔗 GitHub\n🔗 Follow me on Twitter (to stay updated on announcements)\n🔗 Follow me on Mastodon (to stay updated on announcements)","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/livestreaming/","title":"Why I started livestreaming as a Rust developer?"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/mongolia-trip/":{"body":"I went on a trip to Mongolia to find out the meaning behind my name.\nMongolia is a landlocked country in East Asia,\nbordered by Russia to the north and China to the south.\nDisclaimer: This blog post is not a tour guide or a place to get all the information about Mongolia. I just had a great time and wanted to document my experience as a diary with the hope that you might find it interesting!\nIntro\nHey! My name is Orhun.\nIt is a lowkey unique name, even in my country, Türkiye. Especially when you count the other variants such as Orhan, Orkun and even Orçun. I'm not a linguist but I'm assuming they mean the same thing. And meanings are ✨\nEven in the tech world we sometimes think a lot about naming an insignificant variable. That being said, I can't even think of how hard it would be to name an actual human being.\nSo, good job Dad!\nIn my early years in life, I was already aware of the meaning of my name, thanks to the history lessons and from people who already knew about it. A quick Google search also reveals it: it comes from in Mongolia.\nOkay, but what/where the hell are they and what's their importance? When I asked my dad he told me that he was impressed by the history behind it and named me after them.\nThat's cool, but still, why?\nSo I decided to go on a real life quest to answer that question. And who is a better company than my dad to discover/explore this together?\nI'm typing these words on a plane that is about to land in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. 🇲🇳\nThe Flight ✈️\nLet's take a step back and let me tell you the background of this flight. Finding the plane ticket and the correct timing was a bit tricky, but we found a direct flight from Istanbul by frequently monitoring the upcoming flights.\nThen the time has come:\nLoved the name of the plane!\nIt was my first time flying with MIAT Mongolian Airlines (duh!) and I'm pretty happy with the experience/food!\nSpoiler: Food 🥪 (click here to view)\nMost of the flight is spent with writing Rust btw! 🦀\nI also watched some stuff, most notably the Barbie movie 🫠\nArrival 🛬\nWe arrived in Ulaanbaatar at roughly 3 AM. There wasn't much to see in the city at that hour but our friend who picked us up from the airport was kind enough to fill us in with some general information:\nPopulation3.5 million (+ 72 million animals (wow?))\nSize6 million sq km\nLandscapesSteppes, deserts, mountains\nEconomyAgriculture, mining, herding\nReligionTibetan Buddhism (Lamaism), Shamanism, Islam, Christianity\nThis means it is a big country with not a lot of people, but a lot of animals! 🐄🐎🐑\nAlso, we drove though the Ankara Street which is next to the Atatürk School.\nFor me, it is always nice to see these things related to Türkiye! The lights in that street were actually brought from Ankara too.\nAnother interesting thing was there were a lot of Karaoke places. Apparently, it is a big thing in Mongolia.\nIt was a long travel, but we made it:\nI'm in the hotel and gotta sleep now, cya tomorrow.\n1st Day 1️⃣\nStarted the day off with gas station coffee. The traffic was a real problem here.\nBut I solved my realest problem, the internet, by buying a SIM card:\nToday I'm visiting the near Nalaikh.\nThe importance of this is it's the first inscription stone that mentions the word \"Turk\".\nThe Tonyukuk inscriptions are Turkic inscriptions of the 8th century located in Nalaikh, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.\nThey are the oldest written attestations of the Turkic language family, predating the Orkhon inscriptions by several years.\nThey are often confused with, or considered as a part of, the Orkhon inscriptions, although the Orkhon inscriptions are actually located about 462 kilometres (287 mi) to the west.\nOn the way, we stopped for the Friday Prayer and visited the Konya Kültür Merkezi. It was a magnificent cultural experience to speak Turkish with the Kazakh muslims.\nOne thing that they joked about was Turks immigrating from Mongolia on horses,\nwhile they stayed because they ate their horses. Okay.\nThen we arrived at the actual destination, here is how the Tonyukuk inscriptions looked like:\nThe Tonyukuk Inscription is an ancient stone monument from the 8th century, detailing the achievements of Tonyukuk, a prominent official and military strategist of the Göktürk Khaganate.\nIt offers insights into the empire's politics, military campaigns, and mentions Turkic shamanism.\nis a very important figure in the Turkish history.\nClick here for introduction\nThe historical value of these writings were unimaginably priceless.\nWe also visited the security guard's traditional Mongol tent (also called \"ger\") next to the building, which was a nice place:\nAlso, it turns out this is a temporary site and they are in the process of building the actual museum very close to it:\nHoping the visit again in the future when the Tonyukuk museum is complete!\nThe next thing that I remember, I was taking a nap until we arrived at this absolutely mind blowing thing:\nYes, it is a gigantic shiny mighty statue, in the middle of a large steppe.\nGenghis Khan was the founder and first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in history after his conquests in the early 13th century.\nHe is renowned for his military brilliance, leadership, and the unification of nomadic Mongol tribes into a formidable force that reshaped Eurasian history.\nIn fact, it is a museum, you can go inside and explore a bit about the history of Mongolia and Genghis Khan.\nOne of the interesting things was this huge boot (made from Tibetan lamb skin, called \"yak\"):\nThis is a boot specially designed to hide the direction of your footprints. For example, your enemies will see the same oval shape on the snow and they be like \"Is he going forwards this way or backwards?\". Cool trick.\nYou can also climb the statue from inside and get an amazing view.\nThere are also touristic activities that you can do outside:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nEnded the day with some good Mongolian food.\nSpoiler: Food 🥪\nThe rest is just resting &amp; coding in the hotel. Big day tomorrow.\n2nd Day 2️⃣\nToday is the day.\nI'm heading to Kharkhorin (the ancient capital of the Mongol Empire) to see the attributed to two Turkic princes, Kul Tigin and his brother Bilge Khagan.\nThe Orkhon Inscriptions, are ancient Turkic artifacts from the 8th century, found in Mongolia's Orkhon Valley.\nThese inscriptions, carved on stone monuments, commemorate the achievements of the Turkic leaders and the Göktürk Khaganate's history.\nThey provide valuable insights into the early Turkic peoples' language, culture, and political organization, shaping our understanding of Central Asian history.\nWe hit the road pretty early because it will take about 6 hours to reach there.\nOur driver (төгөлдөр/töglödör - his name means piano!) was pretty cool!\n⠀⠀And no, that's not a Swastika. It has another ⠀⠀religious meaning in Mongolia apparently!\nRemember what I said about Karaoke here? Here are some places that I saw before we left the city center:\nThe rest of the road was endless steppes/deserts with some animals hanging out freely (mostly horses, cows and, sheep):\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nAs always, good food during lunch:\nSpoiler: Food 🥪\nBut... we were still in the middle of nowhere:\nWe first decided to make a stop at since it was on our way. It is one of the significant places that helped Buddhism to spread across Mongolia.\nThe buildings there were pretty interesting and we actually had the chance to witness a Buddhist praying session. No recording of it due to obvious reasons.\nNext stop, Kharkhorin Museum:\nThere we learned a ton about Kharkhorin city, such as:\nAncient capital of the Mongol Empire\nFounded by Genghis Khan in the 13th century\nStrategic hub of trade and diplomacy on the Silk Road\nImportant archaeological site revealing insights into Mongol history\nAlso, and most importantly, I was finally getting close to the meaning of my name, which is being the Orkhon Valley.\nVery close! But it's not there yet.\nLearned about Turkic origins in Mongolia as well:\nBtw, do you remember the name of the plane on my arrival? Here is where it comes from:\n, the grandson of Genghis Khan, founded the Yuan Dynasty in China, expanding the Mongol Empire's influence into East Asia. He established Khanbaliq, modern-day Beijing, as his capital.\nOkay, it was time to visit the most important place.\nNotably, we traveled along a road with a Turkish name to reach there.\nAnd here it is! In the middle of nowhere, not looking very mighty, but you can't imagine what's inside!\nWe actually had to ask the people living near the building for the keys. They helped us get in and I'm guessing we had a bargain about the ticket prices. Anyhoo, they were cool! Look at this Mongolian kid posing with his doggo, the absolute boss of the place:\nOne of my favorite pictures from this trip!\nBut eventually he got caught lol\nAnyways, we are finally inside. Big moment.\nLadies and gentlemen... here they are.\nThe hold immense historical significance as they represent one of the earliest known examples of written Old Turkic language.\nThese inscriptions provide valuable insights into the culture, language, and political organization of the Turkic peoples during the time of the Göktürks.\nThey are considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site and are pivotal in understanding the early development of Turkic scripts and the history of Central Asia.\nIsn't this crazy?\nThey gone unnoticed for more than 1000 years and in 19th century they were discovered and deciphered. This discovery sparked significant interest and lead to a deeper understanding of Turkic history, language, and culture.\nI'm glad to have this meaningful name.\nJust to show what inscriptions looked like when they were found, they put a replica outside:\nVery remote place, absolutely mind blowing.\nAfter this, we went had dinner (apparently meat is another big thing here next to karaoke):\nSpoiler: Food 🥪\nBonus Content\nShow me the thing!\nThey first made it 2 meters but apparently some people got disturbed by it so they re-made it like this.\nWe are staying in Kharkhorin today at Secret of the Silk Road Resort, since it is not feasible to go back to Ulaanbaatar. Well, we are staying in a...\nIt was very cozy!\n3rd Day 3️⃣\nWoke up to this scenery with this Mongol doggo:\nLoving this hotel... or resort, idk. It is really cool!\nThe breakfast was nice also. They put a lot of effort into the design of the place obviously.\nSpoiler: Food 🥪\nTIL sea buckthorn:\nThen we left the hotel and started heading to a Buddhist monument on a mountain.\nWhen I checked the map while we were there, I realized something:\nWe are too damn close! This is it. This is where Orkhon inscriptions were placed at. This is where my name comes from.\nWe walked down the mountain and had some amazing time in the nature, next to the .\nThe Orkhon river derives its name from the Old Turkic prefix \"or\" meaning \"middle\", and \"khan\" or king.\nThe Turkish name \"Orhun\" is a transliteration of the word \"Orkhon\" and refer to this river.\nIt holds significant cultural and historical importance due to its association with the inscriptions and the ancient Turkic peoples who inhabited the region.\nThe fresh air, animals, scenery... everything was just beautiful.\nIt is not certain but this place might be also called , the sacred mountain of the ancient Turks.\nIt was mentioned by Bilge Khagan in the Orkhon inscriptions as \"the place from where the tribes can be controlled\".\nA force called qut was believed to emanate from this mountain, granting the local potentate the divine right to rule all the Turkic tribes.\nIt has an important place in Turkic mythology and Tengrism.\nIn the inscriptions, Bilge Khagan advises \"to not get out of the Ötüken forest\", pointing out that Turks shouldn't leave this holy area (and not get tricked by the Chinese).\nHere, you can see Orhun at the Orhun river:\nI loved this place.\nHere is me skipping stones:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nDo not swim!\nHere is the sign that says \"Orhun river\":\nAnd the map of the river:\nHell yes! My quest is complete. Now it's time to go back.\nWe visited an actual desert on the way back:\nMan, this guy...\nHad some food and drove X hours back to Ulaanbaatar. What a day!\nSpoiler: Food 🥪\n4th Day 4️⃣\nToday we are back in Ulaanbaatar, and decided to visit TIKA (Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency) and personally thank them for their guidance and help during our trip.\nLater on, we visited a Buddhist temple located near the center. It was pretty fun!\nOur last historical visit was to the . This museum is pretty big (7 floors) and covers many things including the origins of today's Mongolia. This also includes Turkish history so it was really interesting to see the remaining objects from that era and sharpen my history knowledge.\nI definitely recommend visiting this museum if you ever come to Mongolia. It would take a lot of time to cover everything I saw, so here are some cool pictures from the museum instead:\nAnd here you can see the locations of 3 inscriptions (Tonyukuk, Bilge Khan, Kultigin) marked with red:\nA shaman and some cool painting:\nThe rest of the day was mostly chilling in a café, having dinner and resting before the flight.\nSpoiler: Food 🥪\nBonus Content\nThe minibar was full of minivodka in our hotel :D\nThe Return ✈️\nThe return was kind of eventless. 8 hour flight, sleeping, listening to music, doing stuff - you know.\nI'm typing these words while heading back home and I still can't grasp what happened in the last 3-4 days. It was a crazy experience.\nWe are so back.\nDid I travel 9 thousand kilometers to learn about my name and witness its history? Yes. It was definitely worth it.\nI brought this twig from the Orkhon Valley and now it is a part of our garden.\nAnd that's it.\nI'm , now you know me.

Maybe a new role in a Linux distribution that is for advanced users...\nNo, this is not a blog post about how did I join Arch Linux as a Trusted User in January 2021. You can read my TU application if you came for that. This is more like the aftermath...\nSo right after I've been onboarded, I immediately tried to adapt to my new role and do everything I can in order to be more helpful to this awesome distribution. Well, everything comes with a cost apparently. My agility caused some (tiny?) problems (for me and others) but I also got the chance to do/learn awesome stuff. Here in this very blog post, I'd like to tell what happened in my first month at Arch Linux... for future packagers and for those who wonder what I've been doing in the meantime. Buckle up!\nThe Good Stuff\nPackage additions to the [community]\nIf you know me, you probably know that I like the most memetastic programming language Rust. So I moved a fair amount of tools that are written in Rust along with some other nice projects from AUR to the community repository.\nPackage adoptions in [community]\nI adopted the following packages to help {co-,}maintain them:\ncargo-edit\ncargo-outdated\ncargo-tarpaulin\ndog\ndumb\nhexyl\nintellij-idea-community-edition\nkmon\nlsd\nmari0\nmdbook\nmdp\npycharm-community-edition\nscrot\ntask\ntokei\nxdo\nMistakes\nAt first, I couldn't think of asking AUR maintainers and TUs for permission to move their packages to the [community]. (silly me!) At least no one complained and everyone seemed to be happy about it. I'll remember to be more courteous about this from now on :)\nBut the biggest mistake I ever made happened during I was trying to fix FS#69291... I somehow overlooked the latest stable version of IntelliJ IDEA and built/released the 2021 version which is unstable and not \"intended for production\". However, someone realized my mistake and filled a bug report quickly enough to avert the crisis. (FS#69461) (oof!)\nConclusion\nApart from those, I also helped to handle the AUR requests, fixed some bugs, and contributed to arch-rebuild-order.\nI hope I'll be more useful for the distribution in the future.

(And yes, I'm still a \"college student\".) These 2 weeks were mentally tough and kinda fun so I thought sharing my inner feelings would be also fun to read.\nSo I realized I sometimes feel incredibly depressed during the day on random occasions and occasionally have emotional swirls due to this mental state ever since I have started living/working here. There are a couple of potential reasons that I could think of and I want to go through each one of them to debug my thoughts.\nSunlight\nI could almost say that I feel like the day never ends here due to the sun setting down so late. (11pm-12pm?) I had a kind of a hard time adapting to this situation and it really affected my sleep cycle. I don't feel sleepy although it is pretty late + waking up from a nap feels like morning hours. Once I decided to sleep at 7pm and woke up at 9pm and thought that it was morning time so I almost prepared to go to work. It took me a couple of minutes to realize that it is 9pm, not 9am.\nIt is also affecting the way that my brain works so the poor thing thinks it can work more than it can actually do due to the outside being still bright. Result: burnout.\nWeather\nNo, it is not cold here. It is actually pretty nice, sometimes. But that's not the thing.\nThe weather changes so drastically sometimes. I start the day with a pretty nice weather and 2 hours later it's raining and I'm sitting at the office trying to write code while feeling depressed as hell. The same thing happens when I'm going back home so I constantly feel melancholic and can't enjoy the environment as much as I want. Unfortunately, there is nothing that I can do so I'm trying to adapt to it and get used to feeling like this. I sometimes cry for no reason.\nEmptiness\nUnlike Turkey, there is not much risk/action in the streets in my area so it feels like an empty Garry's Mod map. I don't hear that much noise from my environment as well. I started to think that I have no neighbors. This dosage of peacefulness is driving me crazy.\nLoneliness\nI have never lived by myself before. I have never lived in a foreign country by myself before. Although this sounds cool, it has some side effects on me. I have never been a very social person, I know how to be social, but I didn't prefer it. Now I see the bigger picture and how family/friends/partner is so important in my life. I don't have many friends, but the ones that I have are freaking stallions. I'm also grateful to my girlfriend who supported me always all the way through the Moon &lt;3\nWhat else?\nThere are probably other things that messed with my nerves and I might share them later if you enjoyed reading this overly personal post. Just let me know!\nFor getting out of this situation I'm planning to focus on my projects more and keep trying to do something productive. That's what saved not from failing into the depths of madness and it will work again.\nThanks for sticking around,\norhun","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/norway-depression/","title":"I finally found out why I'm so depressed"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/open-source-funding-with-ratatui/":{"body":"Let's delve into the realm of open source funding along with Ratatui's journey.\nTable of Contents\nRatatui\nWhat happened?\nOur Strategy\nManaging Funds\nThe Future\nExpenses\nSustainability\nCrucial tasks\nSupporting our dependencies\nNon-profit model\nBeyond money\nClosing\nAcknowledgements\nRatatui\nIn case you haven't been following, I have been actively taking part in an open source project called since last year. It is the community maintained fork of tui-rs project which is a Rust library for building terminal user interfaces. Ratatui is the successor of tui-rs and I'm very proud to say that we have built an amazing ever-growing community around the Rust/TUI ecosystem. These awesome TUI tools and libraries and the expanding adoption from companies (such as Netflix's bpftop) are some of the biggest motivations for us to elevate Ratatui to make it the future of the terminal.\nCheck out our GitHub here: https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui\nWhat happened?\nIn November last year, we got an issue in GitHub with the title of .\nThe contents were the following:\nHi Ratatui, I'm one of the core contributors to the Radworks project.\nRadicle has been using Ratatui. It's in fact one of our most critical dependencies!\nAll Radicle’s core-contributors really appreciate the work you all do and we want to make sure that you are all well-funded to keep doing it.\nFor that reason, we have decided to donate some funds to your project through Drips\n(an initiative that is coming out of our organization for funding FOSS).\nThe problem and the proposed solution in the issue were even more interesting:\nProblem: None, you've done amazing work. This is a thank you.\nSolution: Claim funds. Engage on a call to understand what we are trying to do here.\nIf you don't need 100% of the funds, share with your own critical dependencies.\nI especially like the last part!\nNeither I, nor anyone in the team had any idea about this so we quickly started researching what this meant for us. Luke from Radworks was also kind enough to hop on a call with us to explain the process and how the Drips Network works.\nHere are some relevant links if you are interested in reading more about this:\nDrips Network / Radicle Dependencies\nYou can see in there along with other projects!\nPodcast talk\nAt the end of the day, it seemed like we had a funding of $20k+.\nThis was so unexpected and surprising considering that no one was/is working on Ratatui with financial expectations. But no one was opposed to the idea of covering our future expenses!\nOur Strategy\nWhen it comes to funding open source, I see a couple of viable options:\nGitHub Sponsors\nOpen Collective\nOne-time Donation Platforms (e.g. Buy Me A Coffee)\nGrants (such as NLNet Foundation)\nOur situation did not fully apply to any of these, so we have to come up with something.\nI saw that Sebastian Thiel (@byron) (maintainer of Gitoxide) already claimed funds on Drips so I reached out to him about his experience. He gave us very detailed information about his crypto setup, but unlike him, his solution didn't fully fit our needs as a team of 5+ people, because it would be challenging for a single person to manage the funds.\nAnd... taxes? Nobody wants to be responsible for random money sitting in their bank accounts.\nAs some Turkish saying goes: \"If you have the money then you have the problem.\"\nIn hindsight, this made us re-consider the possibility of applying for GitHub Sponsors. After some discussion, we also decided to set up Open Collective alongside of GitHub Sponsors and use Open Collective to manage our funds. We registered our collective to GitHub Sponsors which enabled us to manage everything at one place. Pretty neat feature!\nWe looked into the possibility of doing the same with Drips Network and eventually decided that if Open Collective is able to create a crypto wallet for us, that will presumably be the easiest way to send funds from Drips Network to Open Collective. They would handle taxes and other legal matters for us, and it would be just perfect.\nFor the curious, Open Source Collective (our fiscal host) takes a 10% cut for operating costs.\nManaging Funds\nShout out to Benjamin Nickolls (@benjam) from Open Collective, he greatly helped us to figure out the crypto-related details of things and set up a multi-signature wallet. After this, we managed to get everything dripping 💧\nAll of these were in the works for the past couple of months. We now have the following setup and everything works like a charm!\nYou can see the related transactions on Open Collective:\nThe Future\nNow that we are an open source project and the money is involved, we need to draw some lines about how we manage these funds. Additionally, we need to come up with a thinking model that will be taken as a baseline when it comes to utilizing this financial source.\nExpenses\nIn the simplest terms, the primary and the most traditional reason that companies make money is to stay afloat and expand their business.\nIn our case, these are already semi-covered thanks to open source. We don't usually worry about the project dying, because if that happens tomorrow someone else might fork the project and start Ratatui v2 (which is exactly what we did).\nHowever, there might be still financial costs of maintaining an open source project. These include things such as a custom domain, additional services/servers, promotional elements and so on.\nThus we will be using these funds to cover these maintenance/promotional costs.\nSustainability\nAs companies receive investment, they just don't go \"hey we got the money let's go home y'all\".\nThat is the same in our case as well. We still have a lot to do.\nSo can't we just pay people to do work?\nThat's the beauty of open source, people are already doing work. Not because they want to get rich off of the project, but because they want to learn new things and have some fun on the side.\nPaying people for their open source work will also push the incentive that everyone might get paid through this work. Which means when there is no money left, there might not be a project left to work on.\nHowever, don't get this wrong, this isn't a sneaky approach to make people work for free. We will still support people / other projects that we depend on. Finding the balance is the key.\nIt is good to remember that this policy works for us and is not a one-size-fits-all solution. ⚠️\nCrucial tasks\nWe are happy to support people who are working on core/crucial/technical tasks that won't be worked on otherwise. Some examples might be,\na port of Ratatui on a specific platform (such as supporting embedded LCD displays),\na WASM/Web framework built on top of Ratatui,\na full-fledged game engine that runs on the terminal.\nThis does not give the promise that we will throw money at you if you do one of these.\nBut we absolutely don't say the otherwise 🐭\nThis is similar to Neovim's approach where funded contributors are expected to provide full-time, high-quality contributions on GitHub regularly.\nSupporting our dependencies\nRatatui is dependent on other Rust libraries such as crossterm.\nWe don't want them to go unmaintained, so we are considering to support these other open source projects as well.\nNon-profit model\nTo understand the way that we are aiming to manage our funds, we can take a look at the differences between \"Company vs. Non-profit\":\nCategoryCompanyNon-profit\nFocusProfit generation and maximizing shareholder valuePrimarily focused on serving a mission or cause\nMotiveFor-profitNot-for-profit\nProfit DistributionCan distribute profits to shareholdersCannot distribute profits to individuals or shareholders\nStructureGenerally structured with a hierarchical management systemOften structured with a board of directors or trustees\nTax ObligationsCan face tax obligations on profitsMay be eligible for tax-exempt status and can receive donations/grants\nWe are closer to being a non-profit in that sense.\nThat is why we don't split the funds among maintainers / project members.\nBeyond money\nWhy do people work on this? You invest your time and make no money. What is the point?\nMoney is not everything.\nThe contributors likely stand to gain more from second-order effects such as:\nThe experience you gain from working on the project\nas a Rust programmer, team member, large project maintainer, etc.\nGreater hireability\nthe project is a great portfolio piece, and is also well known in developer circles so it also makes networking easy.\nCommunity engagement\nactive participation fosters a sense of belonging and camaraderie.\nTL;DR: 🌸\nClosing\nWe will be managing the donations/sponsorships we receive through our Open Collective transparently in line with the principles outlined in this blog post.\nWe will be also reaching out to the creator of tui-rs (Florian Dehau (@fdehau)) about offering a one-off donation for his past work on this awesome library. I will update this post with any developments.\nEdit: Florian said he's grateful to see the community taking over the project and doesn't want the donation. He's happy for it to fund the current maintainers' work, as seeing his project thrive without his involvement is a reward in itself.\nTo follow the updates:\n@ratatui_rs on Twitter\n@ratatui_rs on Mastodon\n@orhun on GitHub\n@orhun on Mastodon\n@orhundev on Twitter\nAcknowledgements\n💖 Huge thanks to:\nRadworks for their funding donation.\nRatatui maintainers\nDheepak Krishnamurthy (@kdheepak)\nJosh McKinney (@joshka)\nLeon Sautour (@mindoodoo)\nArijit Basu (@sayanarijit)\n@Valentin271\n@EdJoPaTo\nRatatui moderators (kaliwowski, owletti, @tranzystorekk)\nBenjamin Nickolls (@benjam) from Open Collective\nLucas Fada from Radicle\nSebastian Thiel (@byron) from Gitoxide\nErlend Sogge Heggen (@erlend-sh) for his valuable open source and funding advisories.\n🥂","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/open-source-funding-with-ratatui/","title":"Ratatui Received Funding: What's Next?"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/open-source-grindset/":{"body":"Let's talk about how to develop an open sourcerer mindset.\nVery much like any other open source developer who has a great passion, I have been dreaming about doing open source full-time to make a living. Ever since I started to see the impact of open source and the spirit behind contributing I always wanted to keep doing it. And for a long time, I actually did it without thinking about it too much. It was just fun to share projects, contribute to others, and simply apply the open source philosophy to every part of my life. Well, even though you might say \"just keep doing it if you like it that much\", I think it is time for me to take things more seriously to get close to the dream I initially mentioned.\nThere are a lot of good developers out there who contribute to open source in great magnitudes. Since I'm mainly interested in Rust, I would give @dtolnay, author of serde, as an example. There is also @epage who maintains clap. Another example would be @burntsushi, who made the blazingly fast ripgrep. The point where I'm getting is, there are many people with small/big open source projects who are also contributing to many other small/big open source projects that we use every day. After all, open source got to a point where its importance is now very apparent and non-negligible.\nAmong all of those people, @fasterthanlime got my attention in the last few months. He is already crushing it with very detailed articles (I mean, 60 minutes read time?!) and one of his articles about going full-time open sourcerer opened my third eye, so to speak. Ever since then, I always kept this move in mind as an example of how my little dream is actually achievable.\nSo why am I talking about all of these? Well, I might have finally put together a strategy for being a more successful open source developer and it is time to share it. I hope something will come out at the end of these crazy ramblings.\n(fingers crossed)\nOpen Source Grindset\nBefore I talk about how I do/plan to do open source, I should clarify what \"grindset\" means. It is the new hip word that all the cool kids use and it simply means \"grind mindset\". Here are a few definitions:\nFrom Urban Dictionary:\nThe state of mind one puts oneself in, in order to outperform fears, insecurities, doubts, and anxieties, to achieve the seemingly impossible and step into their greatness.\nAnd Wiktionary says:\nA hypothetical collection of thoughts and actions one may undertake to improve one's financial and social life and to stay on the 'grind'.\nSo, where does that leave us?\nOpen Source Grindset is the state of mind that maximizes one's effort to contribute to open source and increase self-improvement to deepen the technical knowledge in every possible endeavor. It is the act of contributing to open source regardless of the circumstances and ignoring the demotivating outside factors until eventually making a living from it.\nLet's break it down.\nHow to develop the Open Source Grindset?\nThere are not a lot of people that you can argue about \"open source is being good.\" So of course, if you think that way, you would want to keep contributing since it keeps your motivation going and you feel that you can use your creativity without constraints. So in this case, we should talk about motivation first.\nIt is surely not easy to always keep your motivation high but there are surely some tricks. They would be out of the scope of this blog post so I would like to link @ThePrimeagen's video which summarizes it very well.\nTo approach this motivation issue from a different perspective, I would like to talk about how you can benefit from contributing to open source and how might having Open Source Grindset affect your gain in that regard. For this, I will first give a hypothetical example. Afterward, I will be trying to back up this story with a real-world example. Hopefully, these examples will guide you to a realization.\nExample I\nLet's say that there is a frontend developer looking for a job and they have a mild interest in open source. Let's also assume that they have a couple of projects lying around on GitHub that they don't care about too much and the projects are collecting dust. One day, our innocent developer receives an email regarding one of their repositories having a dependency update. They immediately think \"Damn you dependabot!\" but there is certainly a curiosity about this email. So they click the link and this page pops up:\n\"Well, interesting.\" they thought. \"What even is ssri and why/where am I using it?\"\n(Our protagonist turned out to be a junior developer and was not yet aware that JavaScript projects might have dependency trees that go up to the moon so let's ignore the second question for now.)\nThey finally click the link in the repository and it leads to another repository:\nLooking around cluelessly, they saw this piece of code:\n\"So ssri should be some kind of a validation technique, hmmm. But what is that integrity string? What is going on here?\"\nFinally, they decide to ask the daddy (Google) about this and it redirects them to this document:\nThis specification defines a mechanism by which user agents may verify that a fetched resource has been delivered without unexpected manipulation.\nThis document specifies such a validation scheme, extending two HTML elements with an integrity attribute that contains a cryptographic hash of the representation of the resource the author expects to load. For instance, an author may wish to load some framework from a shared server rather than hosting it on their own origin. Specifying that the expected SHA-384 hash of https://example.com/example-framework.js is Li9vy3DqF8tnTXuiaAJuML3ky+er10rcgNR/VqsVpcw+ThHmYcwiB1pbOxEbzJr7 means that the user agent can verify that the data it loads from that URL matches that expected hash before executing the JavaScript it contains. This integrity verification significantly reduces the risk that an attacker can substitute malicious content.\n\"Hmm, okay. Let's see an example.\"\nAn author wishes to use a content delivery network to improve performance for globally-distributed users. It is important, however, to ensure that the CDN’s servers deliver only the code the author expects them to deliver. To mitigate the risk that a CDN compromise (or unexpectedly malicious behavior) would change that site in unfortunate ways, the following integrity metadata is added to the link element included on the page:\n\"Woah. So that integrity attribute along with the hash is called 'Standard Subresource Integrity'. Interesting.\"\nWith this sudden enlightenment, our junior developer remembers that they have a project where they use an external JavaScript resource without any subresource integrity. \"Wouldn't it be nice to add this integrity attribute?\" they say.\nBut how? Luckily, they found a website that generates an SRI hash from a resource URL:\nhttps://www.srihash.org\n\"Great! But wait, can I do this from the terminal?\"\n\"Nice. That was even easier.\"\nFast forward to the future, 2 weeks later, our junior developer is having a job interview with a big tech company and the interviewer asks the following question:\nResources that we use such as JavaScript and CSS files are capable of performing dangerous actions such as password stealing. And usually, compromised third-party servers are used for this type of attack.\nHowever, these servers can provide invaluable services that we can’t simply go without, such as CDNs that reduce the total bandwidth usage of a site and serve files to the end-user much faster due to location-based caching.\nSo it’s established that we need to sometimes rely on a host that we have no control over, but we also need to ensure that the content we receive from it is safe. What can we do?\nOur fellow developer starts to get psyched as the interviewer finishes the question. They immediately remember the research they did 2 weeks ago, thanks to that Dependabot PR. Says with an excited voice:\n\"Oh, we can use SRI for that. It is a security policy that prevents the loading of resources that don’t match an expected hash. By doing this, if an attacker were to gain access to a file and modify its contents to contain malicious code, it wouldn’t match the hash we were expecting and not execute at all.\"\nAnd there, they would not be able to answer this question if they just yolo-merged the Dependabot PR and did not take time to actually look through it.\nThe moral of the story is, rabbit holes are crucial to gain the Open Source Grindset. Even though we don't have a character who is excessively doing open source in this hypothetical example, they still hugely benefited from it. Imagine what you can achieve by being more interested/motivated toward open source.\nExample II\nJust recently I was working on closing the issues (implementing new features &amp; fixing bugs) on my project git-cliff. One of the issues was the following:\nSimply put, OP wanted to easily download the Debian package of git-cliff from GitHub releases. For this, I needed to somehow package git-cliff and provide it via releases.\nWell, I decided to give cargo-deb a try. It was supposed to generate a Debian package from the information in Cargo.toml. Unfortunately, when I tried the cargo-deb command locally, I got the following error:\nThis was due to git-cliff using a readme file in the parent directory:\nWell, that's a bummer. My next step was blindly diving into the code of cargo-deb and actually fixing the issue:\nAfter fixing the issue, I integrated cargo-deb into my release workflow (via this commit) and I was happy. It was time to share my fix with the upstream:\nhttps://github.com/kornelski/cargo-deb/pull/62\nAnd it got rejected. Apparently, cargo was also suffering from this issue and thankfully the author of cargo-deb redirected me to this issue:\nIt was submitted in 2018 and is still open. Do you see where I'm getting at with this?\nEven though I put some time into fixing this issue and my changes were rejected, it paved the way for another (and also a bigger) contribution opportunity. In the following days, I'm planning to focus on this cargo issue and see what I can do about it.\nIf I never dove into the code of cargo-deb, I would never know such a thing would exist for cargo as well. That is why it is important to take your time while you are contributing to open source, I believe.\nIn summary, the rules of developing an Open Source Grindset are:\nTake your time.\nFollow the rabbit holes.\nRead and learn as much as you can.\nEvery contribution is a contribution regardless of its size.\nConclusion\nIn this post, I tried to lay out the mindset that I developed over the years toward open source development. I think of this as a concretization of years of thinking/coding and an early-stage plan for success. We'll see!\nIf I get nice feedback about this post, I might write a sequel about dealing with burnout. So let me know what you think!\nHow can you support me? Well, I have GitHub Sponsors and Patreon 🐻\nbye!","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/open-source-grindset/","title":"Open Source Grindset Explained"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/open-source-motivation/":{"body":"Some thoughts about open source and the software industry.\nBefore I start, I have to make this clear: I will be using the term \"open source\" in the meaning of \"free/libre and open source software\" in this post. It's due to the meaning of \"open source\" might get confusing depending on the context sometimes. Alright.\nIt's been over 4 years that I decided to contribute to the open source community. In the beginning, I was just making my personal projects open source to share with my friends and see what they think. It was more like a free code review tool for me since I didn't know that much about the underlying philosophy and themes of open source. I was a beginner at programming after all and surely I was not expecting too much. As time goes on, I kept putting things up on GitHub and my point of view drastically changed when I realize the benefits of it.\nBasically, I was improving myself and helping people out on solving specific issues or improving their experience. A few things that I'd like to pinpoint here are:\nOften times I was finding myself trying out new techniques to solve a problem. And I was free to do so. There were no deadlines or specifications that I was ought to follow. There were only guidelines that have been set by other open source projects.\nIt was so satisfying to see something that I've built from scratch getting used by people. The feedback that I'm getting through issues and pull requests were showing that I've done something beneficial. Although this was expected since my mentality was always \"I need this, maybe someone else might too\".\n99% of the time I was working with other open source software. They were making my life easier and I was happy to try to build something that makes other people's life easier. I think it would be nice to you pay what you take from the community at some point.\nAnd after those years, these things still count. Perhaps they have a greater significance now.\nToday I have an actual job that pays me for writing lines of code. Back in the day I wasn't expecting too much from my open source activities but it paid off in the end and it still is. I don't remember a point in my life that I have to prove that I \"know\" a programming language/technology for a job. Thanks to open source, it can be seen rather than being said.\nSo what's up with the \"motivation\"? Well, let me explain the mentality of some people around me.\nThere's something that I hear from my close friends which is \"if doing open source carried you somewhere and you got a real job now, you can stop doing open source and focus on the things that will pay you because you know, everything is money\".\n(Let's say this statement is coming from people who don't make anything off of open source, e.g. only hobbyists like me.)\nMaybe you'll call me a lunatic for saying this but I strongly disagree with this statement. Yes, money is important but it is not important enough to just quit my volunteer work that \"actually\" helps people. At the end of the day, I'm not expecting to get too much out of it but I know at least some people will appreciate it. (patrons, hey!)\nI'm not the best at managing time but I think everyone who is involved in open source should keep their bonds with it somehow by managing their \"real working\" times. A couple of hours a day for improving yourself / working on your project or helping out other projects is perfectly fine apart from your actual job, I think. Who knows, maybe your project will grow unexpectedly and you will start your own company and provide jobs for other people. It's a matter of keeping the \"open source\" attitude at this point.\nTo sum it up, I would say open source is more important than we think. It's definitely not just a way of developing software or marketing it, it has its own inner mechanics that will force you to keep yourself learning more.\nSo don't get caught in the wrong vortex.\nJust dream, build and soar.\n~o","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/open-source-motivation/","title":"My motivation towards working on open source"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/packaging-rust-for-npm/":{"body":"Recently I packaged my project git-cliff (changelog generator written in Rust) for NPM with the help of my friend @atlj. I thought this would be an interesting topic for a blog post since it has a certain technical depth about distributing binaries and frankly it still amazes me how the whole thing works so smoothly. So let's create a simple Rust project, package it for NPM and fully automate the release process via GitHub Actions.\nQ: Wait, what? I thought NPM was just for Javascript stuff!?\nA: Actually, no. As long as you have the correct set of tools for executing a binary and packaging it, you're set. It doesn't necessarily need to be a Rust package as well, you can package anything and do anything when the package is installed/executed. That's why NPM is so dangerous! - a topic for another blog post.\nQ: Okay, I see. But... why do this? Can't you just download the binary and run it?\nA: As an answer to this question, I would like to outline my conversation with @atlj. Please note that it's not the actual conversation and we do not talk like that. Or maybe we do. Anyways, here it is:\natlj: Yo orhun, let's package git-cliff for NPM so that it will be more accessible to frontend devs and npx is very convenient for installing/running stuff.\norhun: Sounds good. But how do we do it?\natlj: Check this sh*t out: lefthook (GitHub) &amp; lefthook (NPM)\norhun: Oh, it's a Go project and they have an NPM package. WTF!\natlj: Yeah, we can do the same. Or even better.\norhun: I'm down.\nSo the inspiration came from lefthook and we wanted to see how we can take this approach and apply it to git-cliff.\nIt worked flawlessly! Just run:\nQ: Show me how.\nA: Follow me. 🐇\nNPM\nFirst of all, let's understand what NPM is and how the NPM registry works.\nNPM (originally short for \"Node Package Manager\") is the default package manager for the Javascript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client (npm) and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the NPM registry. This is where we will push our packages.\nThe packages in the NPM registry are in CommonJS format and include a metadata file in JSON format (package.json). The registry does not have any vetting process for submission, which means that packages found there can potentially be low quality, insecure, or malicious. NPM relies on user reports to take down such packages. You can manually check your package to find insecure dependencies by running npm audit.\nTo install a package or the dependencies specified by a package, you can run npm install. On the other hand, npx can be used to run an arbitrary command from an NPM package which is either installed locally or fetched remotely. It handles both installation and execution. In that sense, we can think of it as a shortcut for npm install &amp; npm run.\nAt the end of this blog post, we're aiming to install/run our application with npx &lt;app&gt;.\nOverview\nLet me make it clear that we won't be compiling our Rust application into WASM for packaging it for the NPM registry. That's a wasm-pack task on its own. You can read more about this approach here and here.\nInstead, we will be distributing binaries that are built for different targets (i.e. architectures/platforms). Each NPM package will be responsible for wrapping the target-specific binary and there will be a \"base\" package that is exposed to the end user. This is why this packaging approach is more portable since you only need to compile binaries for different architectures and place the binaries inside NPM packages.\nLet's break it down:\nHere, we are taking the following advantages of package.json:\nbin: This field points to our main executable (a command or local file name) in the package. When the package is installed globally, that file will be linked inside the global bins directory. For example, on an Unix-like OS it'll create a symlink from the index.js script to /usr/local/bin/myapp and in the case of Windows it will create a cmd file usually at C:\\Users\\&lt;Username&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\myapp.cmd which runs the index.js script.\nOne thing to note here is that the file referenced in bin should have #!/usr/bin/env node as shebang, otherwise the script is started without the node executable.\noptionaldependencies: This field is for the dependencies that can be used but not strictly needed for the package. We will be specifying our target-specific NPM packages in this field since we only want to install the appropriate package for the current architecture.\nBut how do we distinguish between different targets and know which optional dependency to install? Well, os and cpu help us to filter the correct dependency among different dependencies.\nos: Specifies which operating systems the package will be running on.\nPossible values are 'aix', 'darwin', 'freebsd','linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', and 'win32'.\ncpu: Specifies which CPU architecture the package will be running on.\nPossible values are 'arm', 'arm64', 'ia32', 'mips', 'mipsel', 'ppc', 'ppc64', 's390', 's390x', and 'x64'.\nPackaging\nOur project structure will be the following:\nLet's create a simple Rust project first:\nNext, we need to add our \"base\" package's package.json file as follows (some fields are stripped):\nAs you can see here, we are setting an optional dependency to each of our target-specific packages so that NPM can decide on the correct package to install based at runtime. So let's add a template for generating these packages.\nHuh, wait. Did you say \"generating\"?\nYes, I think it's a good idea to generate NPM packages during the continuous deployment workflow instead of having 6 different folders and package.json files in our project. The only thing that changes between these packages is the name, os, and the cpu fields so we can simply create them from a template via envsubst(1).\nConsidering this, we can come up with the following template:\nOkay, that's cool and all but where do we put the binary?\nGood question. Our directory structure will look like this after we generate package.json file and build the binary:\nNow we know that the correct optional dependency will be installed alongside our base package and it will contain the binary. But, how do we locate it and execute it? Well, that's why we have our src/index.ts:\nWhen we build the package via yarn build, it will generate lib/index.js which will be our entrypoint for the wrapper.\nAfter we have everything in place, we can simply publish these packages via npm publish. However, please note that optional dependencies should be present in NPM registry for building a package. This means that you need to publish each optional dependency before attempting to publish the base package. Otherwise, you might get an error like the following:\nAutomation\nWe can automate the publishing process of the NPM packages with a GitHub Actions workflow which runs when a tag is pushed or a release is created.\nAs you can see above, we need to use a build matrix for building binaries and publishing the target-specific NPM packages. For that, we can create the following matrix:\nHere, we have the following fields in each matrix field:\nNAME: Name of the build (formatted as &lt;os&gt;-&lt;arch&gt;-&lt;env&gt;).\nOS: Type of machine to run the job on (i.e. runner).\nTOOLCHAIN: Type of the Rust toolchain.\nTARGET: Type of the Rust target (i.e. target triple).\nThe important part is we will later use NAME to derive the name of the NPM package. For example, linux-x64-glibc will correspond to &lt;app&gt;-linux-x64.\nNext, we can build a binary for each build target as follows:\nAnd then, we finally generate the NPM package and publish it:\nAs the final step, we publish the base package in another job:\nHere is the complete workflow file:\n`cd.yml` (*click to expand*)\nWhy use app-windows-x64 instead of app-win32-x64?\nIf you read the GitHub Actions workflow file carefully, you might have realized there is an extra check for publishing the package as app-windows-x64 although using app-win32-x64 would be easier because we already named our build matrix as win32-x64-msvc.\nThe reason for that change is the NPM registry itself:\nnpm ERR! 403 403 Forbidden - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/app-win32-x64 - Package name triggered spam detection; if you believe this is in error, please contact support at https://npmjs.com/support\nApparently, NPM doesn't like numbers in package names and recognizes them as spam. As stupid as it sounds, it's true. Other people on the internet also suffered from this issue:\nStupid npm 😡 the name of chip is pcf8575, which name should I use?\na random NPM victim\nHowever, I reached out to the support and they actually helped me to publish the win32 package.\nHi Orhun,\nSorry to hear about the trouble you were having.\nWe've initiated some blocks related to package names. Our hope is this will help with both security and spam concerns we're facing.\nAs support, we're able to move beyond the block. I've published the git-cliff-win32-x64 and git-cliff-win32-arm64 packages and transferred write access to the packages over to your orhun user account.\nBut it's better to just have it named as windows since we don't want to deal with the spam protection mechanism.\nResult\nAfter publishing the NPM packages for your Rust project, you can use npx to install/run the application. For example:\nAs an alternative to npx, you can use dum which is a faster alternative written in Rust:\nConclusion\nI hope this guide was helpful for people who want to do crazy stuff like putting their Rust projects on NPM!\nAll the code can be found in this repository: https://github.com/orhun/packaging-rust-for-npm\nCheers!","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/packaging-rust-for-npm/","title":"Packaging Rust Applications for the NPM Registry"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/ratatui-0-21-0/":{"body":"\"Ratatui\" came a long way since its transition from the original tui-rs crate. In this post, let's take a look at what's new in the latest version.\nRetrospective\nTo catch you up to speed:\n14-08-2022: The original author of tui-rs created an issue for discussing the future of the crate.\n02-02-2023: I and a couple of people who are interested in the project created a Discord server to discuss the possibility of forking the project.\n08-02-2023: The author got back to us and proposed a plan for transferring the ownership to the new maintainers. This was the last time we heard from him about the project :/\n14-02-2023: We created a fork to continue development.\n19-03-2023: The first version of ratatui is released. (0.20.0)\nEver since then, a number of people joined us for development and crates started to switch to ratatui. And today, we are proud the announce the new version of the project!\nBefore everything, big thanks to Florian Dehau for making this possible and creating tui-rs in the first place! 💖\nNow, let's see what's new in ratatui!\nFull changelog: https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/releases/tag/v0.21.0\nNew backend: termwiz\nratatui supports a new backend called termwiz which is a \"Terminal Wizardry\" crate that powers wezterm.\nTo use it, enable the termwiz feature in Cargo.toml:\nThen you can utilize TermwizBackend object for creating a terminal. Here is a simple program that shows a text on the screen for 5 seconds using ratatui + termwiz:\nNew widget: Calendar\nA calendar widget has been added which was originally a part of the extra-widgets repository.\nSince this new widget depends on time crate, we gated it behind widget-calendar feature to avoid an extra dependency:\nHere is the example usage:\nResults in:\nNew widget: Circle\nCircle widget has been added with the use-case of showing an accuracy radius on the world map.\nHere is an example of how to use it with Canvas:\nResults in:\nInline Viewport\nThis was a highly requested feature and the original implementation was done by @fdehau himself. Folks at Atuin completed the implementation and we are happy to finally have this incorporated in the new release!\nAn inline viewport refers to a rectangular section of the terminal window that is set aside for displaying content.\nIn the repository, there is an example that simulates downloading multiple files in parallel: https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/examples/inline.rs\nBlock: title on bottom\nBefore you could only put the title on the top row of a Block. Now you can put it on the bottom row! Revolutionary.\nFor example, place the title on the bottom and center:\nResults in:\nBlock: support adding padding\nIf we want to render a widget inside a Block with a certain distance from its borders, we need to create another Layout element based on the outer Block, add a margin and render the Widget into it. Adding a padding property on the block element skips the creation of this second Layout.\nThis property works especially when rendering texts, as we can just create a block with padding and use it as the text wrapper:\nRendering another widget should be easy too, using the .inner method:\nText: display secure data\nA new type called Masked is added for text-related types for masking data with a mask character. The example usage is as follows:\nResults in:\nborder! macro\nA border! macro has been added that takes TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT, and ALL and returns a Borders object.\nAn empty border!() call returns NONE.\nFor example:\nThis is gated behind a macros feature flag to ensure short build times. To enable it, update Cargo.toml as follows:\nGoing forward, we will most likely put the new macros behind macros feature as well.\nColor: support conversion from String\nHave you ever needed this conversion?\nDon't worry, we got you covered:\nSpans -&gt; Line\nLine is a significantly better name over Spans as the plural causes confusion and the type really is a representation of a line of text made up of spans.\nSo, Spans is renamed as Line and a deprecation notice has been added.\nSee https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/pull/178 for more discussion.\nOther features\nList now has a len() method for returning the number of items\nSparkline now has a direction() method for specifying the render direction (left to right / right to left)\nTable and List states now have offset() and offset_mut() methods\nExpose the test buffer (TestBackend) with Display implementation\nNew apps\nHere is the list of applications that has been added:\noxycards: quiz card application built within the terminal.\ntwitch-tui: twitch chat in the terminal.\ntenere: TUI interface for LLMs.\nAlso, we moved APPS.md file to the Wiki so check it out for more applications built with ratatui!\nMigration from tui-rs\nWe put together a migration guide at the Wiki: Migrating from TUI\nAlso, the minimum supported Rust version is 1.65.0\nContributing\nAny contribution is highly appreciated!

In this post, I'm sharing what's new in the latest version and also a fun way to easily create terminal user interfaces in a jiffy.\nSee my previous blog post about ratatui for retrospectives and the status of the project.\nToday marks the new release of ratatui and we are very excited to share the new things we have been working on in the last month. But before anything, a couple of news about the project:\nWe had a meeting on 2023-07-16, you can read the meeting notes here.\nWe will have scheduled meetings soon for discussing the status of the project more often. (Still deciding the time &amp; day for that).\nJoin the Discord server for keeping up-to-date with ratatui news and contributing to the project!\nWe appreciate everyone who contribute to the project and most importantly Florian Dehau for creating tui-rs in the first place! 💖\nToday, I decided to do something different and share a fun thing that has been on my mind for a while before going into what's new in ratatui.\nSo, without further ado, let's dive into it! 🐁\nGenerating terminal user interfaces\nI have a new open source project coming up in the next months and I am happy to say that I have been using ratatui extensively to build it from the ground. Although it is fun to write TUI code, I sometimes think if it would be possible to find an easier/faster way to avoid boilerplate code and speed up the development. We are still working on improving the widget/stylization API of ratatui to avoid code repetition but still, I sometimes find myself rewriting the same code over and over again.\nOne day, I had a flashback to a moment from months back where I needed to design a very basic HTML page but I was too lazy to do it and used ChatGPT for it. Well, what if I generate the TUI code as well and save myself from the burden of imagining the widget positions in my mind and trying to code out abstract things. That would be nice, right?\nQ: Well, ChatGPT does not support image processing for now. So why waste your time writing prompts for your design instead of writing the actual code instead?\nA: Who said I am going to write prompts?\nQ: Huh?\nThat's right. While I was using ChatGPT to generate that simple HTML page, I came up with a text-based but also visual solution. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you:\nASCIIFlow: a client-side only web based application for drawing ASCII diagrams.\nGitHub: https://github.com/lewish/asciiflow\nhttps://asciiflow.com\nSo you can simply draw boxes, lines, arrows, texts, and whatever you imagine on a canvas and export it (or copy it to the clipboard) easily.\nIn case it isn't clear, our plan is to:\nDesign the interface on ASCIIFlow.\nGive the ASCII design (text) to ChatGPT.\nGenerate Rust (ratatui) code.\nProfit.\nLet's try it!\nPrompt: Write the Rust code for using tui-rs library for building the following terminal user interface:\nUnfortunately, ChatGPT doesn't have the knowledge of ratatui yet and it cakes its pants when you want to use it so we are using tui-rs in our prompt. Also, it suggests using tui-rs 0.16.0 which shows how much it is left behind.\nBut anyways, it can generate some usable Rust code for us.\nIf we remove the unrelated parts such as terminal/backend initialization and event handling, we are left with:\nClick to expand\nWhich is clearly wrong but can be a good stepping stone for what we actually want to build.\nHere is the final layout code with some edits:\nClick to expand\nAnd here we have it:\nWhat's new?\nNow that we have seen what we can do using ratatui, it is time to get into the details of the latest release!\nFull changelog: https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/releases/tag/v0.22.0\nPrelude\nWe now have a prelude module! This allows users of the library to easily use ratatui without a huge amount of imports.\nAside from the main types that are used in the library, this prelude also re-exports several modules to make it easy to qualify types that would otherwise collide. For example:\nNew widget: Scrollbar\nA scrollbar widget has been added which can be used with any Rect. It can also be customized with different styles and symbols.\nHere are the components of a Scrollbar:\nTo use it, render it as a stateful widget along with ScrollbarState:\nWill result in:\nBlock: support multiple titles\nBlock widget now supports having more than one title via Title widget.\nEach title will be rendered with a single space separating titles that are in the same position or alignment. When both centered and non-centered titles are rendered, the centered space is calculated based on the full width of the block, rather than the leftover width.\nYou can provide various types as the title, including strings, string slices, borrowed strings (Cow&lt;str&gt;), spans, or vectors of spans (Vec&lt;Span&gt;).\nIt can be used as follows:\nResults in:\nBarchart: support groups\nBarchart has been improved to support adding multiple bars from different data sets. This can be done by using the newly added Bar and BarGroup objects.\nThis makes it possible to render fancy stuff like this:\nSee the barchart example for more information and implementation details.\nStylization shorthands\nIt is possible to use style shorthands for str, Span, and Paragraph.\nA crazy example would be:\nThis especially helps with concise styling:\nStylize everything!\nAll widgets can be styled now (i.e. set_style)\nStyled trait is implemented for all the remaining widgets, including:\nBarchart\nChart (including Axis and Dataset)\nGauge and LineGauge\nList and ListItem\nSparkline\nTable, Row, and Cell\nTabs\nStyle\nConstant styles\nStyles can be constructed in a const context as follows:\nMore colors formats\nIt is now possible to parse hyphenated color names like light-red via Color::from_str.\nAdditionally, all colors from the ANSI color table are supported (though some names are not exactly the same).\ngray is sometimes called white - this is not supported as we use white for bright white\ngray is sometimes called silver - this is supported\ndarkgray is sometimes called light black or bright black (both are supported)\nwhite is sometimes called light white or bright white (both are supported)\nwe support bright and light prefixes for all colors\nwe support - and _ and as separators for all colors\nwe support both gray and grey spellings\nFor example:\nIntegrations\nFollowing tools are now integrated into the repository:\ncargo-husky: git pre-push hooks\nbacon: background code checks / coverage\ncommitizen: conventional commits\ncargo-deny: linting dependencies\ntypos: spell checker\nOther\nBenchmarks added for the Paragraph widget\nAdded underline colors support for crossterm backend\nMark some of the low-level functions of Block, Layout and Rect as const\nThe project license has been updated to acknowledge ratatui developers\nEndnote\nFeel free to join the Discord server for chatting/getting help about ratatui.

It has been 6 months since we started working on ratatui and today I am excited to once again announce that just recently ratatui became the official successor of tui-rs! This is a big improvement for the project and it truly shows the power of open source and the greatness of the Rust community. I am thrilled to be a part of this project and make ratatui the most of the terminal user interface lover's favorite crate. As of now, existing tui-rs projects started to migrate to ratatui and we got overall positive feedback from the maintainers. Also, new and very interesting ratatui projects are being created every day and being shared on our Discord / Matrix. Come join us and do not miss these new terminal apps and contribution opportunities!\nOn a personal note, ratatui is an amazing experience for me since I have met great people and had the chance to work with them on this kickass open source project. I also learned a ton of new things about Rust and open source maintenance. On the other hand, I believe I vastly improved my community-building and communication skills. At the end of the day, the hard work continues and we are all human. It is important to not forget that. 🐻\nAlright, without further ado, let's jump into what happened so far.\nRetrospective\n14-08-2022: Future of tui-rs discussion is created.\n02-02-2023: We created a Discord server to discuss the possibility of forking the project.\n08-02-2023: The author got back to us and proposed a plan for transferring the ownership.\n14-02-2023: We created a fork to continue development.\n18-02-2023: We had our first ratatui meeting. You can read the notes here.\n19-03-2023: The first version of ratatui is released. (0.20.0)\n01-04-2023: We had another meeting. (notes)\n29-05-2023: 0.21.0 is released. (blog post)\n15-07-2023: Our biggest meeting so far! (notes)\n17-07-2023: 0.22.0 is released. (blog post)\n07-08-2023: The original author archived the tui-rs repository and ratatui became the official successor. 🎉\nSee the related commit &amp; security advisory.\nSuch an adventure we had! And the best part is, it continues... In that regard, I would especially like to thank Florian Dehau since he created tui-rs and made all of this possible! 💖\nNow, let's get to what's new in ratatui! Buckle up, we're about to cook up some terminal interfaces.\nFull changelog: https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/releases/tag/v0.23.0\nCoolify everything 😎\nWe already had a cool name and a logo, and now we have a cool description as well:\nWe also renamed our organization from tui-rs-revival to ratatui-org:\nhttps://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui\nBarchart: horizontal bars\nYou can now render the bars horizontally for the Barchart widget. This is especially useful in some cases to make more efficient use of the available space.\nSimply use the Direction attribute for rendering horizontal bars:\nHere is an example of what you can do with the Barchart widget (see the bottom right for horizontal bars):\nVoluntary skipping capability for Sixel\nSixel is a bitmap graphics format supported by terminals.\n\"Sixel mode\" is entered by sending the sequence ESC+Pq.\nThe \"String Terminator\" sequence ESC+\\ exits the mode.\nCell widget now has a set_skip method that allows the cell to be skipped when copying (diffing) the buffer to the screen. This is helpful when it is necessary to prevent the buffer from overwriting a cell that is covered by an image from some terminal graphics protocol such as Sixel, iTerm, Kitty, etc.\nSee the pull request for more information: https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/pull/215\nIn this context, there is also an experimental image rendering crate: ratatu-image\nTable/List: Highlight spacing\nWe added a new property called HighlightSpacing to the Table and List widgets and it can be optionally set via calling highlight_spacing function.\nBefore this option was available, selecting a row in the table when no row was selected previously made the tables layout change (the same applies to unselecting) by adding the width of the \"highlight symbol\" in the front of the first column. The idea is that we want this behaviour to be configurable with this newly added option.\nRight now, there are 3 variants:\nAlways: Always add spacing for the selection symbol column.\nWhenSelected: Only add spacing for the selection symbol column if a row is selected.\nNever: Never add spacing to the selection symbol column, regardless of whether something is selected or not.\nTable: support line alignment\nNow results in:\nScrollbar: optional track symbol\nThe track symbol in the Scrollbar is now optional, simplifying composition with other widgets. It also makes it easier to use the Scrollbar in tandem with a block with special block characters.\nOne breaking change is that track_symbol needs to be set in the following way now:\nIt also makes it possible to render a custom track that is composed out of multiple differing track symbols.\nsymbols::scrollbar module\nThe symbols and sets are moved from widgets::scrollbar to symbols::scrollbar. This makes it consistent with the other symbol sets. We also made the scrollbar module private.\nSince this is a breaking change, you need to update your code to add an import for ratatui::symbols::scrollbar::* (or the specific symbols you need).\nAlpha releases\nThe alpha releases (i.e. pre-releases) are created *every Saturday* and they are automated with the help of this GitHub Actions workflow. This is especially useful if you want to test ratatui or use unstable/experimental features before we hit a stable release.\nThe versioning scheme is v&lt;version&gt;-alpha.&lt;num&gt;, for example: v0.22.1-alpha.2\nAdditionally, see the following issue for possible contributions in the context of alpha releases and documentation: https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/issues/412\nExample GIFs\nWe added GIFs for each example in the examples/ directory and added a README.md for preview. This should make it easier to see what each example does without having to run it.\nSee: https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/examples/README.md\nOne thing to note here is that we used vhs for generating GIFs from a set of instructions. For example:\nResults in:\nWe also host these GIFs at https://vhs.charm.sh but there is an issue about moving everything to GitHub. If you are interested in contributing regarding this, see https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/issues/401\nCommon traits\nWith the help of strum crate, we added Display and FromStr implementation to enum types.\nAlso, we implemented common traits such as Debug, Default, Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd, Hash to the structs/enums where possible.\nTest coverage 🧪\nratatui now has 90% test coverage!\nShoutout to everyone who added tests/benchmarks for various widgets made this possible.\nNo unsafe ⚠️\nWe now forbid unsafe code in ratatui. Also, see this discussion we had in the past about using unsafe code for optimization purposes.\nThe book 📕\nWe are working on a book for more in-depth ratatui documentation and usage examples, you can read it from here: https://ratatui.rs/introduction/\nRepository: https://github.com/ratatui-org/website\nOther\nExpand serde attributes for TestBuffer for de/serializing the whole test buffer.\nAdd weak constraints to make Rects closer to each other in size.\nSimplify Layout::split function.\nVarious bug fixes and improvements in Barchart, Block, Layout and other widgets.\nAdd documentation to various widgets and improve existing documentation.\nAdd examples for colors and modifiers.\nWe created a Matrix bridge at #ratatui:matrix.org.\nEndnote\nFeel free to join our Discord / Matrix for chatting/getting help about ratatui.

It does its job very well by providing an easy-to-use interface for /proc/sys. It is maintained as a part of procps toolkit for years and it can easily be considered a legacy tool today. So why not push it to its limits and turn it into a more user-friendly and even more useful tool with the power of Rust?\nsysctl\nsysctl depends on procfs and works by accessing/modifying the kernel parameters that reside in /proc/sys directory. The basic functionalities of sysctl are the following:\nList parameter values: sysctl -A\nSet a parameter value: sysctl -w parameter=1\nA more concrete example would be:\nConsidering this simple example, how different use cases could you have, and what role does systeroid play?\nsysteroid\nhttps://github.com/orhun/systeroid\nsysteroid is \"sysctl on steroids\". Similar to sysctl, it is implemented using procfs and the primary goal is to manage the kernel parameters. It has a bunch of features to ease the process of reading and modifying the values and even retrieving information about them from the official Linux kernel documentation. It also has a text-based user interface to visualize the state of the kernel parameters and interactively perform these management operations.\nComparison\nIf you compare the --help output of systeroid with sysctl, you will see that they are compatible with each other, also meaning that systeroid encapsulates the functionality. There are some additional arguments/flags which is the actual thing that gives systeroid its power:\n-T, --tree: display the variables in a tree-like format\n-J, --json: display the variables in JSON format\n-E, --explain: provide a detailed explanation for variable\n-D, --docs &lt;path&gt;: set the path of the kernel documentation\n-P, --no-pager: do not pipe output into a pager\n-v, --verbose: enable verbose logging\n--tui: show terminal user interface\nsysteroid can also be used as a drop-in replacement for sysctl.\nOutput formats\nsysteroid -A is the simplest way of listing the kernel parameters. In addition, there is also -T, --tree flag which will output a tree:\nYou can also -J, --json to get the output as JSON:\nExplain\nLet's assume that you have faced a particular problem and someone on Stack Overflow recommended using the following command:\nIn this case, you might ask what is \"kernel.oops_all_cpu_backtrace\" and what does setting it to 0 do?\nThis is where systeroid comes in to help:\nThe command above will fetch the corresponding information from the Linux kernel documentation and yield the results to stdout via less. Similarly, you can run systeroid with -E, --explain argument to retrieve information about any other parameter (as long as they are present in the kernel documentation).\nSo how does this work?\nAs you might have guessed, you need to have the kernel documentation \"installed\" or cloned somewhere. Distro packages solve this by having the kernel documentation as a separate package and in that case, all you have to do is install that package. (e.g. linux-docs in Arch Linux) In case this is not applicable, you need to clone the kernel repository and specify a path via -D, --docs argument. There is a convenience script in the repository.\nAfter the kernel documentation is supplied to systeroid, it parses the corresponding sysctl files (using parseit crate) and caches them for the next run. This way, documentation about each parameter can be shown to the user.\nFor more information, see the README.md#showing-information-about-parameters.\nTUI\nsysteroid has a terminal interface that can be launched via systeroid-tui (binary) or systeroid --tui (alias).\nCurrently, the following actions are supported:\nBrowse the available parameters\nView the documentation\nSearch for parameters\nUpdate the value of a parameter\nCopy to clipboard\nAnd more!\nThe colors are also customizable and I'm thinking of adding a configuration file to customize the TUI in the future.\nEndnote\nMy primary goal for the future of the project is simply adding more ways to conveniently manage the kernel parameters. I also plan to work on the existing issues. I hope systeroid will help you out in ways that will improve your workflow and the security of your kernel :)\nIf you liked systeroid and/or my other projects on my GitHub, please consider supporting me on GitHub Sponsors or Patreon! 🐻\nGörüşmek üzere!","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/rewriting-sysctl-in-rust/","title":"Rewriting sysctl(8) in Rust: systeroid"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/setting-up-this-blog/":{"body":"Like my blog? Here is how I set it up.\nAs my FOSDEM 2025 talk (\"Bringing terminal aesthetics to the Web\") is approaching, I thought it would be a good idea to take a step back and think about minimal web design. And I believe my blog is a good example for taking apart to the pieces and understand what makes a minimal website minimal.\nAlso, some people requested me to share which tool/language/kit I'm using for writing these posts.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, here it is.\nP.S. The source of this blog is available here.\nEngine ⚙️\nMy blog is proudly powered by Zola, a static site generator written in Rust. I chose Zola because it's fast, simple, and has many features.\nAll you need is a single binary installed in your system, and you can start building your blog by running:\nThis command will give you a simple directory structure with a configuration file, where you can tweak many settings including title, description, RSS feed etc.\nIn a nutshell, you simply add your posts in the content directory in markdown format, and run zola build to generate the static HTML files. Easy peasy.\nSee the overview for more information.\nTheme 🎨\nThe colors, fonts, styles... ugh... the hardest part when it comes to making something appealing.\nLuckily, Zola has many themes that you can pick from. All you need to do is download the theme and put it in the themes directory, either by adding it as a submodule or old-the school way (i.e. cloning the repository). Also, don't forget to set the theme field in the configuration file!\nI'm no designer, but I know what I want. Some find it unappealing, but I really like the terminal-like simplicity and markdown rendering of the after-dark theme.\nSo the next step for me was to clone that theme and start making tweaks in the CSS (and yes it was a bit painful but whatever).\nComments 💬\nAh, right. The comments section is very important, otherwise where would people leave their hate comments?\nIt is important for feedback and discussions too!\nutteranc.es is a great widget for adding comments to your Zola blog. The catch is, it is built on top of GitHub issues. So each comment on these posts are stored in the respective GitHub issue. You can check them out here.\n➡️ Try it out, leave a comment below and go check the issue on GitHub. I'd appreciate genuine feedback too!\nTo set this up, follow the instructions on the website. For me, it's a matter of adding this snippet to the footer of page.html:\nLike Button 💖\nI don't like Medium for its paywall and tracking, but I like their \"claps\" feature. So people can show their appreciation without leaving a comment.\nLuckily, I found about the applause-button project which is exactly what I wanted. A zero-config button for applause/claps/kudos to blog posts.\nAdding it was also simple:\n1. Add the script to index.html:\n2. Add the button to page.html:\nHowever, this button no longer works :(\nSee this issue:\nApologies all, I've had to retire the hosted service. For the first ~4 years the donations I was receiving from OpenCollective were just about covering the running costs. However, in the past 6 months usage increased significantly, with millions of requests each day, and the costs simply went out of control. If you want to keep using applause button I'm afraid you're going to have to host it yourself.\nSuffering from success, huh?\nFor now this button is dysfunctional, but I might self-host it in the future or switch to something else. Let me know if you know any alternatives!\nSearch 🔍\nThis is my latest addition to the blog and I'm surprisingly satisfied with it. See the search box on the top right corner.\nUnfortunately the instructions on the Zola website were not very clear to me, so I followed this blog post for setting this up.\nIn a nutshell, what you need to do is:\nEnable building the search index (build_search_index=true) and set JSON as the index format ([search].index_format=\"elasticlunr_json\").\nAdopt the search script from the Zola repository along with other HTML and CSS rigmarole.\nSee this commit for my implementation. (it's not the best, you have been warned)\nAnalytics 📈\nNeedless to say, I don't like Google Analytics. I don't want to be tracked by them, and most importantly I don't want you to be tracked by them.\nSo I set up an instance of Umami, an open source analytics service. I'm running it on a Digital Ocean droplet that I'm funding via GitHub Sponsors.\nMy analytics are also public, you can check them out here.\nFor the tech savvy out there, I'm using this docker-compose.yml to run the Umami service:\n⚠️ If you host it like this, make sure to follow the releases and do the required database migrations before updating the image version. Otherwise, you might break stuff and lose data. Speaking from experience.\nAutomation 🤖\nI'm using GitHub Actions for automating the deployment and checking the content.\n1. deploy.yml: This workflow runs for pushes to the main branch and pull requests. It uses the following actions:\n⭐ shalzz/zola-deploy-action: Builds and deploys the blog.\n⭐ rossjrw/pr-preview-action: Creates a preview of the blog from pull requests.\nThe second action that I'm using is pretty useful for checking if everything is good before publishing your blog posts. Just an aside, it can be used with other static site generators too, not just Zola.\n2. ci.yml: This workflow runs for pushes to the main branch, pull requests and every week on Sunday (0 0 * * 0). It checks the content with the following actions:\n⭐ lycheeverse/lychee-action: Checks the markdown files for broken links. Uses lychee under the hood.\n⭐ codespell-project/actions-codespell: Checks the markdown files for spelling mistakes. Uses codespell under the hood.\nRecently I have been thinking of switching to typos for spell checking.\nLet me know if you have any suggestions for other tools that I can use for linting!\nStatic Content 🧊\nGit is not a storage server!\nIf you want to host large images, I recommend that you use a separate service for that, instead of bloating your repository.\nFor that, I'm hosting my images on a simple Nginx server on the same droplet where Umami is running. I needed this setup specifically for my Mongolia post since it contains a lot of images.\nConclusion ✨\nMy blog is not that impressive (yet), it's just a static site. What I want to achieve is to make it fully browsable on the terminal. Also vice-versa, I want to make a terminal UI for my blog that is fully browsable on the web. The latter has been already achieved by this blog which is built with Ratatui, the project that I'm working on. We will see where this rat hole will lead me.\nAnyhoo, I hope this post was helpful for you.

Here are my findings after diving deep into this rabbit hole.\nI have been using the terminal (i.e. command-line) for most of my day-to-day things for a while now. I was always fascinated by the fact that how quick and convenient the command-line might be and that's why I'm a proponent of using CLI (command-line) or TUI (terminal user interface) applications over GUI (graphical user interface) applications, when it is possible. On top of my already existing preference, I started to wholeheartedly believe that the after seeing the recent developments in the terminal user experience with tools like Zellij and GPU-powered terminal emulators such as Alacritty/Wezterm/Rio. When this huge potential is combined with a robust systems programming language such as Rust, the result is often times a very smooth terminal and development experience which I think every developer appreciates when it comes to effectiveness, speed and safety.\nThat is most likely why I was drawn into building terminal user interface applications with Rust in the first place. When I built my first ever Rust/TUI project, kmon, I was surprised by how the limits of a simple thing such as a terminal can be pushed to build applications which gets you addicted to using terminals even more. Couple of years later, I'm one of the maintainers of Ratatui which is a Rust library for cooking up TUIs and I'm blessed to be one of the core team members which revived the unmaintained tui-rs library as Ratatui last year.\nWhen you take all of this into account, as a daily terminal user and a command-line developer, I'm tackling new terminal related issues every day. Sometimes I come across really interesting questions and problems. As you might expect, this blog post is the fruit of one of those questions.\nWhy stdout is faster than stderr?\nOkay, now let's take a step back and try to understand the question first. We need to grasp some concepts about UNIX before everything.\nTable of Contents\nI/O Streams\nTUI Applications and I/O\nMeasuring FPS\nProfiling\nTesting the buffered theory\nExperimenting with buffered writes\nExperimenting with raw writes\nMaking stdout faster\nFindings\nOther Languages\nConclusion\nUNIX operating system brought many groundbreaking advances into the world of computers and undoubtedly one of them was the standard streams. According to UNIX, every process has three streams opened for it when it starts up:\n0. Standard Input (stdin): for reading input.\n1. Standard Output (stdout): for writing conventional output.\n2. Standard Error (stderr): for printing diagnostic or error messages.\nHere is an oversimplified example to demonstrate these streams:\nThese I/O (input/output) streams are typically attached to the user's terminal via tty (TeleTYpe) which can be described as an interface that enables access to the terminal.\nAs you might have heard multiple times, \"everything is a file\" according to the UNIX philosophy. This means that the I/O streams should also be a file and this is in fact true:\nIf you have realized, the file descriptor (unique identifier) of these abstract files are the same as the initial list given above (starts from 0).\nSo if they are files, we should be able to read them right?\nActually, no-\n*types quickly*\nWhy nothing is happening?\n*sigh* It is because they are not real files, they are just file descriptors linked to TTY or PTY (i.e. emulated TTY AKA PseudoTeletYpe).\nAs you can see, the standard streams are attached to PTYs (i.e. pseudo-terminals) under /dev/pts.\nWait, so /dev/stdout is a symlink to a file descriptor at /proc/self/fd/1 and that file descriptor is a symlink to /dev/pts/20!? What even is /dev/pts/20 in this case?\nbruh, what?\nIn Unix, character special files are files that access to I/O devices such as a NULL file (/dev/null) and file descriptors. In our case, stdout is a file descriptor (1) so it is a character special file. (The name \"character special\" actually comes from the fact that each character is handled individually.)\nEach character special file has a device major number, which identifies the device type, and device minor number, which identifies a specific device of a given device type. So what you see on the right (136/20) means:\nMajor 136: a PTS device (/dev/pts)\nMinor 20: device 20 (/dev/pts/20)\nOk cool, but why am I not able to read from /dev/stdout?\nOh that, yes. When you try to read data from stdout, it keeps running because it's waiting for data to read from the file descriptor. So if you give it input, then you can read it back:\nNow that we have a general understanding of I/O streams, we can jump to the real world examples and make progress towards answering our question.\nThe following section makes use of the Rust programming language but the overall concepts are generally appliable to any programming language - even HolyC.\nTerminal user interfaces leverages the terminal by drawing widgets/components such as text inputs, spinners and styled text on it, similar to the traditional graphical user interfaces. The terminal is able to render such elements thanks to the custom handling of ANSI escape codes. These ANSI sequences are used to control the cursor location, color and styling of the terminal.\nSo in order the create a terminal user interface, we need a low-level library for controlling both the terminal and I/O streams and also rendering the UI components. Usually, this two step process is split between different libraries for ease-of-use and the sake of single responsibility principle.\nFor example, while ncurses (one of the oldest TUI libraries written in C) is taking care of the low-level interface to the terminal, CDK (curses development kit) provides a sets of widgets to build GUI-like applications in the terminal.\nSimilarly in the Rust ecosystem, the following libraries are the most preferred ones for this task today:\ncrossterm: pure-Rust cross-platform terminal manipulation library.\nratatui: lightweight library that provides a set of widgets and utilities - supports different backends including crossterm.\nSo let's build a very simple TUI using these libraries:\nsimple-tui.rs (click here to expand)\nYou can run this using rust-script as follows:\nDepending on your terminal size, you will get a result similar to this:\nThat's cool! How does that happen?\nLet's break down the code into multiple steps to understand what's going on:\n1. Initializing the terminal\nIn the main function, we use crossterm to set up our terminal on stdout and tell ratatui to use the crossterm backend.\nRaw mode and alternate screen?\nEnabling raw mode means that we won't be using the default behavior of the terminal (no input handling and special keys) and we would like to have full control over it. We are also entering an alternative screen (i.e. new buffer) on the terminal since we don't want to lose our actual terminal/command-line and go back to it when 'q' is pressed.\nSpeaking of input handling, here is how we do it:\n2. Handling key events\nWe are simply polling events from crossterm in handle_events function and quit when 'q' is pressed:\n3. Rendering widgets\nAnd lastly, this is where ratatui shines:\nHere, we are creating two widgets:\nParagraph: contains a centered text\nBlock: wraps the paragraph with a title\nratatui provides many other widgets and makes it surprisingly easy to build complex interfaces. Also, as you can see from the example, it is actually easy to center a div text.\nGoing back to our original topic, if you take a look at the main function again, this all happens on stdout:\nObviously, we can try changing all the references of std::io::stdout to std::io::stderr and try running again.\n... then what happens?\nWell, nothing changes visually and we can't tell a difference. It is the same result.\nOr is it?\nWe need a way of measuring the performance of the rendered TUI and see the difference between using stdout and stderr. For that, I came up with a FPS (frames per second) counter application along with some monochrome colors for visualization (based on ratatui's colors_rgb template).\nstdout-vs-stderr.rs (click here to expand)\nPress space to switch between stdout and stderr:\nDid you notice the FPS drop? stdout is than stderr on a 550x360 terminal!\nBefore diving into the Rust code, let's take a look at the runtime externally via observing the CPU and system calls to understand what is going on.\nFor this task I will use a profiling tool called samply.\nsamply is a command line CPU profiler which uses the Firefox Profiler as its UI.\nIt records a profile of the given command's execution and then opens profiler.firefox.com in the browser where we can inspect a bunch of stuff like which functions were running for how long, flame graphs and timelines. We can even see the source code for the calls and which lines were sampled how many times.\nLet's start by installing samply:\n(I recently packaged it for Arch Linux so it is also available via pacman -S samply btw)\nAnd then we need to make some changes to the code that we are going to profile. For Rust projects, it is recommended that we build in release mode with debug info for getting inline stacks and source code view. So we can add the following profile to our Cargo.toml:\nAlso, I made some changes to the previous stdout-vs-stderr.rs:\nRemoved the parts such as FPS widget which are irrelevant for profiling.\nAdded STREAM environment variable for starting the TUI with the specified I/O stream.\nAccepts either \"stdout\" or \"stderr\"\nAdded DURATION environment variable for exiting the TUI after a certain number of seconds.\nstdout-vs-stderr-profiler.rs (click here to expand)\nNow we can build the binary with the profiling profile:\nTo record a profile, simply run samply:\n(Or you can use my run-profiler.sh script which does everything for you.)\nOnce the TUI exits after 5 seconds, samply will greet us with profiler.firefox.com:\nAfter we do the same for stderr via STREAM=\"stderr\", we can start comparing what went differently for the I/O streams.\nThese profiles are also available for online browsing if you want to experiment yourself:\nstdout profiling (download as a file)\nstderr profiling (download as a file)\nRight off the bat, you can see the difference on the CPU view (first one being stdout):\nstdout has 708 samples compared to stderr which has 3,315 which means stdout made than stderr in the course of 5 seconds! We are definitely on to something.\nNext, we can figure out the characteristics of the each call. It is safe to assume that there will be some write calls to the terminal for each render. We can zoom in on the CPU view to see the each render more clearly:\nAs you can see, stdout rendered in the same timespan as stderr. Also, there are more lighter yellow spikes happening for stderr (on every render) compared to stdout (occasionally).\nWe will figure out what those spikes are shortly.\nWe can zoom in even more and take a look at the calls that have happened for each render:\n&lt;&amp;std::io::stdio::Stdout as std::io::Write&gt;::write_all\n(click here to expand)\n&lt;std::io::stdio::StderrLock as std::io::Write&gt;::write_all\n(click here to expand)\nNow it makes sense, those spikes were write_all calls. It is nice to find that out, but what does that even mean?\nIt means that:\nstdout called write_all and it happens every once in a while.\nstderr called write_all and it is called multiple times for almost every render.\nWe can see this more clearly from the stack chart (first one being stdout):\nLastly, we can check the code of this call but it is not really helpful since it is abstracted:\nSo, what is the take away from all of this?\nThe conclusion is that stdout making less write calls thus able to render more frames in the same amount of time. In other words, stderr blocks until the write function for each frame is rendered to the terminal whereas stdout returns faster.\nThere must be some happening for stdout.\nLet's remember the change that we have made which led us to this point:\nSo, something internal changes when we do this. ratatui's CrosstermBackend is a good place to look first:\nThe CrosstermBackend struct is a wrapper around a writer implementing Write, which is used to send commands to the terminal. It provides methods for drawing content, manipulating the cursor, and clearing the terminal screen.\nWrite?\nWrite is a Rust trait for objects that can be used for writing byte streams. It has methods such as write, flush and most importantly write_all which we encountered before. The code above means that CrosstermBackend can work with anything that implements Write such as File, &amp;mut [8] and other types including Stdout. This abstraction helps us to use the backend with different structs.\nThat's why the compiler is not complaining when we change the argument from Stdout to Stderr.\nOkay so ratatui uses stdout as a writer and sends it to crossterm for writing. In this case, we need to go one layer deeper to crossterm to see what it is doing different for stdout and stderr.\nActually, no. Take a look at this diagram:\nAs you go deeper, the capabilities of the passed type are constrained by the implementation. In other words, if you accept a parameter that is Write, you have only a set of functionality you can work with (write, write_all, etc.) In this case, crossterm does not have any chance to tell stdout from stderr to act different upon it, because it only knows about \"a type\" that is write.\nThat's why we need to go shallower, that being the point we started, Stdout and Stderr structs.\nWait, are you saying that we need to check out the source code of the Rust standard library to get an answer to this? Doesn't that mean that stdout is not always faster than stderr and it depends on the implementation details?\nExactly. \"Everything is a file\", remember? stdout and stderr are also files which are no different. Rust must be doing some magic in this case. 🪄\nTo find out the magic, we can take a look at the definition of Stdout:\nstd/src/io/stdio.rs#L535-L540\nNow let's see Stderr:\nstd/src/io/stdio.rs#L778-L780\nTake a look at the diff:\nHmm... So Stdout is additionally wrapped in another struct called LineWriter.\nYes, do you see where this is going?\nLineWriter wraps a writer and buffers output to it,\nflushing whenever a newline (0x0a, '\\n') is detected.\nWe can use LineWriter to write one line at a time, significantly reducing the number of actual writes to the file.\nThis is what we were looking for all along. Let's try it!\nlinewriter.rs\nIf we run this code:\nFrom this output, we can observe:\nFirst eprintln! message is printed and the writer waits for newline character to write to stdout (even though we already called write_all before).\nThe second part of the poem is printed as a whole until the last line.\nLast line is not being printed until we flush the stdout.\nAlthough this might seem like a pretty weird behavior at first glance, it actually has a huge performance benefit and it is the reason why stdout is much faster than stderr!\nSee you in another blog pos-\nWait! Is that it?\nYou're right, we can actually do more with this information.\nLet's go back to the standard library definition of Stdout:\nstd/src/io/stdio.rs#L535-L540\nYeah, what's up with that FIXME comment there? Also, what is BufWriter?\nGood questions, the documentation explains BufWriter very well:\nA BufWriter keeps an in-memory buffer of data and writes it to an underlying writer in large, infrequent batches.\nBufWriter can improve the speed of programs that make small and repeated write calls to the same file or network socket.\nIn other words, BufWriter writes data to its internal buffer instead of the actual stream and then infrequently writes this collected data to the stream.\nIsn't that the same thing as LineWriter?\nGood point! They actually have a distinction when it comes to flushing (i.e. when the buffered data is written to the stream).\nBufWriter: flushes when the internal buffer is full.\nLineWriter: same behavior as BufWriter but also flushes for each line (when 0x0a or \\n is detected).\nAlso, they both flush when the writer goes out of scope.\nTo make it more clear:\nLet's change our previous LineWriter example to use BufWriter:\nbufwriter.rs\nWe will see that nothing is printed until we flush the BufWriter:\nWhen it comes to the comment on the stdout struct:\nThis should be LineWriter or BufWriter depending on the state of stdout (tty or not).\nWhat is being said here is that stdout should automatically decide between (LineWriter) and (BufWriter) based on whether if it is attached to a TTY or not.\nSo stdout should no longer be line buffered when outputting to a non-terminal (like piping output to a file).\nI didn't get it, what is the advantage of using BufWriter in this case?\nIn the case of a non-TTY, let's say writing to a file, this would mean that the output will be block buffered thus we won't be making system calls for each line. In other words, we won't be flushing continuously which is a huge performance benefit. This can save us from substantial overhead when working with larger files.\nAnd this is actually implemented in Rust but the pull request is not merged: #115652\nAlso, it would be super nice have a way to opt-in for block buffering for stdout in the future. There is a related discussion here: #60673\nWhat would be the benefit of that?\nCheck out this code for example:\nKeep in mind that println! is writing to stdout and it is line buffered (i.e. uses LineWriter) as default. In other words, it flushes the terminal for each line and performs a system call!\nNow take a look at this:\nHere, we are wrapping stdout in a BufWriter which makes it block buffered ✨\nblock-buffered-stdout.rs (click here to expand)\nWhen we run it:\nBlock buffered stdout runs !\nNice! I wonder what happens if we apply this to our TUI app.\nWe can try by doing this change:\nHmm, there isn't a noticeable increase in performance. What if we try something more substantial like using a . The default stderr is not buffered, remember?\nYeah... Oh! I have a better idea. How about making the stderr line buffered? Stdout is also line buffered so are we going to get the same performance?\nYes, let's try that!\nDamn, did we just make the performance of stderr identical to stdout just by making it line buffered?\nOh yeah, looks like it!\nHow about we do the opposite of what we have done so far and try to make stdout unbuffered. This would degrade the performance and we should probably get a result similar to using the default stderr. Let's prove our hypothesis!\nIf we take a look at our findings so far:\nI/O StreamBuffering\nstd::io::stderr()Unbuffered/raw\nLineWriter&lt;std::io::stderr()&gt;Line buffered\nBufWriter&lt;std::io::stderr()&gt;Block buffered\nstd::io::stdout()Line buffered\n???Unbuffered/raw\nSince stderr() returns a raw stream as default (i.e. StderrRaw), it is easier to implement a buffering layer on top of it. However, stdout() function already returns a buffered stream so we need to somehow get a raw stream.\nIf you remember the contents of Stdout:\nstd/src/io/stdio.rs#L535-L540\nWe need the StdoutRaw for an unbuffered stream rather than having it wrapped inside LineWriter. The type definition also confirms the unbuffered behavior:\nstd/src/io/stdio.rs#L45-L49\nNice. This comment leads us to stdout_raw function:\nstd/src/io/stdio.rs#L69-L81\nEasy, we can just construct a raw stdout via calling stdout_raw!\nNot really, that is a private function.\nThere is actually a tracking issue from 2019 about exposing raw stdout/stderr/stdin: #58326\nCurrently there is not easy/obvious way to get an unbuffered Stdout/err/in. The types do exist in stdio, however they are not public for reasons not noted.\nFor example these types would be useful for CLI applications that write a lot of data at once without it getting unnecessarily flushed.\nAnd sadly, there isn't still an easy/obvious way to get an unbuffered I/O streams as of now :(\nBut!\nThis issue gives us some hints about possible workarounds. One thing that is reiterated a couple of times in the issue is that we can use from_raw_fd on Linux as a workaround.\nLet me guess, from_raw_fd takes a file descriptor and we are simply going to use the file descriptor of stdout (which is \"1\") to create an unbuffered stream.\nExactly!\nBut...\nIf we read the documentation of from_raw_fd:\nSafety: The fd passed in must be an owned file descriptor; in particular, it must be open.\nThere are more details to it (which I will cover in another blog post) but the moral of the story is, we need to put our code in a unsafe block like so:\nIf you run it, you will see \"test\" on stdout. Yay! \\o/\nHowever, as mentioned briefly in the previous section, there is still a big problem with this code. Going back to the documentation of from_raw_fd:\nThis function is typically used to consume ownership of the specified file descriptor. When used in this way, the returned object will take responsibility for closing it when the object goes out of scope.\nWhat this means is that raw_stdout variable takes ownership of the file descriptor and it will close the stdout when it goes out of scope. In other words, when the created File is dropped, stdout is closed.\nRIP.\nWe can confirm this behavior with this code:\nraw-stdout-broken.rs\nWhat you expect to see is \"test1\" and \"test2\", however, stdout is closed after we leave the first function. When we try to open it again, it will panic because of the safety rule (the fd passed in must be an owned file descriptor + it must be open).\nThat's bad. What do we do?\nIn our case, we want the open file to live through the entire program. Let's also assume that this is a TUI program and we have separate functions where passing the raw_stdout value around isn't possible.\nWell, there is still one quick dirty workaround: lazily initialize stdout and make it globally available via lazy_static (or another crate such as once_cell):\nraw-stdout-1.rs\nOkay okay, this is a bit too much. I mean lazy, static, mutex, locking etc... Don't we have a better way to handle this? Besides, you can't really construct any other stdout instances with this code.\nActually there is a better way. The documentation of FromRawFd gives us a hint:\nConsuming ownership is not strictly required. Use a From&lt;OwnedFd&gt;::from implementation for an API which strictly consumes ownership.\nSounds like we can work around closing the stdout if we use OwnedFd.\nAn owned file descriptor.\nThis closes the file descriptor on drop. It is guaranteed that nobody else will close the file descriptor.\nSo we can create a ✨ ✨ like so:\nraw-stdout-2.rs\nIf we want a more elegant solution, we can go for as_raw_fd function of Stdout instead of using plain \"1\":\nAll of this pain, why?\nSo that we can do this:\nYeah, I almost forgot we were doing TUI stuff. I think the original question was \"Is raw stdout as slow as raw stderr?\".\nYes, let's find that out:\nAnd that concludes it, raw stdout has the same performance as raw stderr.\nAll of the things we have done so far begs the question: can we make stdout faster?\nWell, we now know that the reason why stderr is slower than stdout is that it is not buffered. So can we somehow achieve a faster (more performant) I/O with stdout by doing something like \"better buffering\"?\nOne other thing we can do to achieve a better FPS is that reducing the write calls that are made. However, crossterm/ratatui is already doing some optimizations such as not rendering the cells that are not changed. Our issue is that the FPS counter example we are using has cells that are always changing so this optimization has no effect. On top of that, we set both background and foreground colors so each render essentially takes multiple write calls.\nIn the screencast below, I modified the crossterm backend of ratatui to highlight the cells that are not being changed between renders. You can clearly see from the number of red cells that we are not able skip a lot of write calls since mostly everything is changing on the terminal:\nHowever this is not the case for most of the TUI applications and this optimization actually saves us from re-rendering the majority of the screen.\nAnother interesting thing to look at is the buffer size. We can observe the following with a smaller buffer size (100 bytes) and delay between renders:\nWhereas a bigger buffer renders bigger chunks:\nWe won't see a big difference if we remove the sleep except if we use very small/big buffer then the FPS drops vastly. We can probably experiment with the buffer size to draw a single line for each render but I wasn't able to get a better FPS in my attempts.\nOne other thing to mention, there were recent developments on ratatui to achieve a better performance for rendering cells. However, this doesn't have a big impact on FPS but definitely an improvement for using less resources.\nWe can keep experimenting with the low level functions of crossterm / ratatui to further optimize things but I feel like that would be a better topic for the part 2 of this post.\nWhile writing this, I wasn't able to achieve a \"faster stdout\" so feel free to leave comments about your suggestions!\nHere is the ratatui + crossterm rendering comparison for stdout and stderr using unbuffered / line-buffered / block-buffered writes:\nstdout-vs-stderr-all.rs\nThe takeaway from this is that I/O streams have similar performances when the same buffering technique is used. We can also say that std::io::stdout() is than std::io::stderr() because the use of line-buffered vs no buffering.\nIf you want to reproduce the same results, I used the following environment in my experiments:\nBackend: crossterm\nTUI/rendering: ratatui\nTerminal: alacritty\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 4700U with Radeon Graphics (8) @ 2.000GHz\nGPU: AMD ATI Radeon RX Vega 6\nRAM: 24GB\nI'm curious about how the results might change in different systems/terminals so feel free to share your findings below!\nWhat we have covered so far only applies to Rust so it would be interesting to take a look at what other programming languages are doing in terms of buffered I/O.\nGo\nos.Stdout is unbuffered as default. It is possible to make it buffered as follows:\nI'm guessing same applies for os.Stderr as well.\nPython\nWhen printing interactively, sys.stdout is line buffered. Otherwise, it is block buffered like regular text files. The sys.stderr is line buffered in both cases.\nOne cool thing about Python is that we can actually make both streams unbuffered by passing the -u option or setting the PYTHONUNBUFFERED environment variable.\nC\nNow brace yourself because this might come as a bit of a surprise to you: when you printf() or fprintf() or use any I/O functions like that, it does not normally work immediately. For the sake of efficiency, and to irritate you, the I/O on a FILE* stream is buffered away safely until certain conditions are met, and only then is the actual I/O performed.\nAs you can already tell, the I/O streams are buffered as default. However, this is configurable via setbuf() or setvbuf() function:\nFor example, to turn off buffering for stdout:\nThis documentation has a good explanation of the different buffering options and related examples.\nHere is an example for line buffering:\nZig\nThe I/O streams are unbuffered. We can achieve buffered writes as follows:\nC++\nstd::cout is buffered according to this article.\nCouldn't find your favorite programming language on this list?

Some call it old habits, some call it needless effort, but I'm very used to downloading MP3 files over the internet and putting them in a folder on my phone then using the whatever default media player I have installed. However, for a couple of years, I have been following a better and automated approach for taking my music offline and feeling a bit less like I'm in a consumerism bubble.\nWhile I'm working, I usually have YouTube open on one tab playing music. So I created a separate YouTube account/channel dedicated to creating playlists. In my workflow, after saving what I listen to a playlist, the next step would be downloading these tracks as MP3 and transferring them to my phone. But before I dive into details about how I'm doing that, there are some questions that I would like to answer.\nQ: If you already have your music on YouTube, why not use YouTube on your phone?\nA: I would like to be able to listen to music when I'm offline (i.e. when there is no internet connection).\nQ: Have you heard of YouTube Music?\nA: Yes, is it free?\nQ: But YouTube is full of ads, isn't it annoying?\nA: I have an AdBlock extension.\nQ: You are using YouTube at the end of the day. Doesn't it conflict with what you are trying to achieve while saying \"move away from streaming platforms\"?\nA: Yes, it is partially true. But I would like to discover new artists/music so I need a \"source\" for that. I'm only taking the good parts of YouTube (e.g. its algorithm) and self-hosting the rest.\nQ: What about supporting the artists?\nA: Streaming is not the only way to support an artist.\nQ: Why are you doing this?\nA: I would like to keep the hard copy of the media that I want to consume. I don't want to leave everything to \"the cloud\" and I find that wrong. Also, in some cases, I have witnessed the removal of the music that I like since I follow rather obscure artists. Plus, having physical files is great for collecting/archiving purposes. TL;DR: I love files.\nQ: Is this a meme?\nA: No, check out \"Boomer Yells at Cloud Computing\" by Luke Smith.\nOverview\nCreate playlists on YouTube\nDownload MP3 from YouTube periodically\nSynchronize the MP3 files over to your phone\nUse an open source MP3 player to listen to music\nThings that you need\nA home server (base of operations)\nI have a Raspberry Pi 4 running Arch Linux ARM\nAn external drive (for storing MP3 files)\nI have a 2.5\" external hard disk drive with 1TB of storage connected to my Raspberry Pi\nA YouTube account (for creating playlists)\nyoutube-dl (GitHub) (for downloading playlists)\nSyncopoli (GitLab) (for rsync'ing MP3 files to an Android phone)\nMusic Player GO (GitHub) (for actually listening to music)\nSetting up the storage\nIn my case, I just connected my external hard drive to Raspberry Pi and updated /etc/fstab to mount it on boot.\nSo it will be mounted to /mnt/tera on boot. Note that I have HPFS/NTFS/exFAT filesystem on this drive and your situation might be different.\nNext step is creating a separate directory on this drive (since I have some other files) and symlinking it to somewhere more convenient.\nSo that I will be able to use /backups as a directory pointing to my backups in the drive. Later on, I will be downloading the MP3 files to /backups/YouTube directory.\nCreating a YouTube account\nI like having things separated so I suggest having a YouTube channel just for creating playlists. You can create these playlists as public or private since youtube-dl supports both. You can use --cookies argument for specifying a cookie if needed.\nThen you can start creating playlists as you are discovering new music/artists thanks to the great algorithm of YouTube!\nDownloading playlists\nIn order to keep track of the downloaded videos (tracks), we will need to use download-archive feature of youtube-dl.\nWith this feature you should initially download the complete playlist with --download-archive /path/to/download/archive/file.txt that will record identifiers of all the videos in a special file. Each subsequent run with the same --download-archive will download only new videos and skip all videos that have been downloaded before. Note that only successful downloads are recorded in the file.\nSo running the following command will suffice our needs and download the each playlist in their designated folder:\nEach directory will contain the MP3 files from that playlist:\nList of video IDs will be stored in .archive:\nAlso, I wanted to keep track of what I have added to this list so I've used a git repository. Here is the final script:\nSetting up the cronjob\nNow we will need to create a cronjob for periodically downloading the playlists using the previous script.\nThis cronjob will run weekly and download the playlists.\nHere is what git log will look like after you let it run for a couple of weeks:\nSyncing the files\nI'm using Syncopoli to rsync(1) files over to my phone. It is a really simple yet effective application. Some parts are still WIP but you can head to the repository and contribute if you're interested.\nMain screen:\nSettings:\nI had a couple of issues with my settings so it is always a good idea to monitor the SSH connection attempts on your server while trying out Syncopoli:\nIn my case, this command greatly helped me to spot issues like the following:\nfatal: Timeout before authentication for 192.168.1.37 port 60044\nerror: maximum authentication attempts exceeded for orhun from 192.168.1.37 port 60038 ssh2 [preauth]\nAlso, you can use Logcat Reader to see which rsync commands are being run and what has failed.\nFor me, the biggest challenge was to use my private key for the SSH connection. To do that, you need to convert your key to dropbear format:\nBut even though I did this, I still couldn't connect:\nuserauth_pubkey: signature algorithm ssh-rsa not in PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms [preauth]\nI solved this issue by adding the following line to my /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restarting sshd:\nThen everything worked perfectly and I managed to transfer files to my phone.\nHere is what my sync profile looks like:\nJSON export:\nI had to use ../../ for the origin directory since rsync is launched from $HOME as default. Maybe there is another way to achieve this but this worked well so I didn't look into other options. If you know a better way, let me know!\nTweaking rsync settings\nThe default arguments that are passed to rsync are the following:\n--verbose, -v: increase verbosity\n--recursive, -r: recurse into directories\n--links, -l: copy symlinks as symlinks\n-times, -t: preserve modification times\n--no-perms: do not preserve permissions\nAdditionally, I'm using the following flags/arguments:\n--compress, -z: compress file data during the transfer\n--human-readable, -h: output numbers in a human-readable format\n-P: equivalent to --partial --progress. Its purpose is to make it much easier to specify these two options for a long transfer that may be interrupted.\n--update, -u: skip files that are newer on the receiver\n--exclude=PATTERN: exclude files matching PATTERN\nKeep in mind that you can use --dry-run, -n flag to perform a trial run. It is also a good idea to create another profile on Syncopoli for dry-run.\nI also suggest having albums and long mixes in a separate playlist so that you can --exclude them with rsync to avoid long download times.\nListening to music 🎶\nAfter going through all these steps and automating the download/sync process, there is one simple thing left to do: feed your soul with music via Music Player GO!\nAnd there you have it, an alternative approach to how you can enjoy listening to music offline while actually owning the data.\nConsider supporting me on GitHub Sponsors or Patreon :3\nTake care!","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/take-your-music-offline/","title":"Move away from streaming platforms & take your music offline"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/upgrading-rust-jwt/":{"body":"Recently one of my clients requested me to maintain their Rust project. It is a web server that is built with Rocket + Diesel and running stable for a couple of years now. Like any other Rust developer would do, the first thing that I checked was the outdated dependencies via cargo-outdated. The result was close to what I expected: most of the dependencies were out-of-date. However, among all those crates, rust-jwt caught my eye. It was 12 minor versions behind!\nAlthough this doesn't seem like a big problem, since it is not a major version or anything, I took this lightly and started working on updating the other dependencies. It is the JWT that everyone knows and loves after all, how hard updating this dependency would be?\nWell, it turns out, it was pretty hard after in my case.\nThe version that the project used at the time was 0.4.0. When I checked the changelog (release notes), there wasn't even an entry about it! Even worse, this version is not tagged on GitHub. The oldest version on GitHub was 0.5.0 and the release notes are the following:\nUpdate (very outdated) dependencies\nThe only user facing changes are much needed updates to the crypto dependencies, courtesy of #10.\nTypes from the previous crate, rust-crypto are replaced with types from various crates from https://github.com/RustCrypto.\nAlthough this is a good improvement for the library itself, it surely didn't look too good for me. I have spent some time deciphering what these release notes mean and it eventually boils down to rust-crypto crate being unmaintained since 2016.\nRUSTSEC-2016-0005: rust-crypto is unmaintained; switch to a modern alternative\nSo the maintainer of rust-jwt made the most expected thing by moving away from rust-crypto and migrating the cryptography-related operations to be handled by the actively maintained RustCrypto project. I was sure I will benefit from this change in the security and performance aspect.\nOne thing to note here, was that really a \"minor\" change in rust-jwt? Can I just bump the dependency and call it a day?\nWell, I don't know. I thought to myself \"Hey let me bump it to the latest version, it's all minor changes anyways\". That's why I updated it to 0.16.0 and took a look at the previous changelog entries before attempting to compile the project.\nSo it seemed like I will be dealing with 2 issues:\nSide effects of \"rust-crypto -&gt; RustCrypto\"\nNew API\nUse case\nTo demonstrate my use case of this library, I wrote this oversimplified Rust script:\nAfter upgrading the dependencies, the script looks something like this:\nLet's check the output of both scripts:\nHmm, they print different tokens and the second one is visibly shorter for some reason. This is probably due to the API changes in the library.\nSo what? Just upgrade the dependencies, it works.\nWell, that's right. However, there is a bigger problem.\nArchitecture\nIn the current architecture, JWT tokens are stored on the user device and used for authentication. On top of that, there is a \"use without registration\" feature of the app which means users can take a look at the app and use some of the features without logging in but still they will have a JWT token associated in case they want to register later on.\nAt the end of the day, changing the JWT decoding logic in an incompatible way would make the tokens of those \"anonymous\" users invalid thus they will be logged out and lose their data. On the other hand, normal users will also be logged out but a new JWT token will be generated on login. Anonymous users cannot log in because... well, they are anonymous.\nAt this point, I realized I was dealing with a dependency that will eventually affect ~100k users. Simply bumping rust-jwt will discard all the existing JWT tokens and make the application unusable for the majority of the users. Some time passed and I put more thought into this topic and we came up with a solution with the help of my colleague:\nAdd an API endpoint for renewing the JWT token of a user.\nCall this endpoint from the mobile application to renew the user token.\nHope that most of the users will update the app and have their tokens renewed.\nAlthough this sounds like a feasible solution, it requires an unnecessary amount of time and work. Plus I had different priorities at the time so I postponed it for later, thinking that I will eventually feel less lazy to implement and coordinate this.\nUnsurprisingly, it didn't happen.\nInspection\nI decided to debug this issue further and understand the root cause of this problem. Why would two different versions of the same library yield two completely different and incompatible tokens? There wasn't even a major change in the library!\nLet's inspect the previously generated tokens with jwt-cli:\nThe newer version of rust-jwt strips the empty (null) fields from claims, that's why the generated token is different (and shorter than I expected). Also, typ field is missing from the header.\nYou already know where this is going. I'm going to modify the rust-jwt library for my needs!\nLet's solve the missing header field problem first by explicitly specifying typ while defining the header:\nNice! We have the correct header fields in the generated token. Also, why not update the Default implementation of Header so that we can use it as it was before?\nhttps://github.com/orhun/rust-jwt/commit/a2433724a4ed4f1e028624968b6f0d4eb67c4734\nTa-da!\nNext step, let's figure out why null fields do not exist in the token.\nThe answer is shrouded in the struct definition of RegisteredClaims:\nBingo! skip_serializing_if attribute in combination with \"Option::is_none\" causes None fields to be removed from the generated token. So let's just remove that attribute.\nhttps://github.com/orhun/rust-jwt/commit/4ef2ff4768a6485281e1bd451dee502bfc185d0d\nThat should be enough, right?\nUhm... verification failed. It is because we allowed Option types by removing the serde attribute so we should update the generic parameter from String to Option&lt;String&gt; in our expected claims data in the script:\nGood. We now have null fields in the claims. But do we have the same data in tokens generated by both scripts?\nYay! It is the expected output. Let's check the tokens too if they are the same:\nUh-oh... Token data is exactly the same according to jwt-cli but tokens are different. What is going on?\nWE'VE BEEN BAMBOOZLED.\nIt turns out jwt-cli was wrong /o\\\nIt uses jsonwebtoken under the hood for decoding the tokens and this library has the same serde attribute:\nSee jsonwebtoken::Header\nSo that's why null fields are not shown in the output. 🤦🏼‍♂️\nLater on I used jwt.io to compare the data of the both tokens and it revealed the following result:\nSo only kid is missing from the header? Alright, easy:\nhttps://github.com/orhun/rust-jwt/commit/b8c4b78d357fa20f54afc4c1ddcc0cb29479e1a4\nHow about now?\nOooh, they need to be in the same order as well. Let's reorder the struct fields:\nhttps://github.com/orhun/rust-jwt/commit/c6d2fb9cc635ee0beafdeaebdac68c5d9e0d7c23\nThat should be fine now. Please god!\nWHAT!? OH... WAIT... They look so similar. Only the signature part is slightly different:\n(/ instead of _ &amp; + instead of -)\nWell, it turns out they are actually the same token. According to the warning on jwt.io, the difference is due to the first token not being encoded correctly:\nWarning: Looks like your JWT signature is not encoded correctly using base64url (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5).\nNote that padding (\"=\") must be omitted as per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-2\nJust to be safe, I decided to replace the invalid characters in the signature before verifying:\nhttps://github.com/orhun/rust-jwt/commit/3a47cae2b5d2a12a46548c07646305f1df0e1253\nAnd then I tested it with different tokens and had no issues, meaning that this -slightly modified- version of rust-jwt is used in production now! 🎉\nThe final version of the script\nI pushed the changes in the rust-jwt library to my fork in case anyone hits this incredibly specific issue: https://github.com/orhun/rust-jwt\nThanks for coming down with me to this rabbit hole! 🐇\n(Special thanks to Tim Heide for bringing this issue to my attention.)\n~ cya!","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/upgrading-rust-jwt/","title":"How hard upgrading a Rust JWT library could be?"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/zero-deps-random-in-rust/":{"body":"Let's investigate how to generate random numbers without external dependencies in Rust.\nRandom numbers are very interesting. It feels like magic that we can generate such unpredictable entropies from deterministic sources.\nBut how does this happen? Before jumping into the generation of random numbers in Rust, let's understand the process of random number generation and how true randomness could never be created without special hardware.\nIs random really random?\nFirst of all, nothing is truly random when we consider the modern computers that we use on daily basis. This is because they are designed to be deterministic. What this means is that, given some initial state and an operation to perform, we can predict exactly how the machine will evolve. Simply put, for the given inputs 2 and 2, we know the operation 2+2 will be outputting 4. This makes total sense since we don't want to wonder what an addition will do, we just want to 'add'. However, this situation of certainty is incompatible with generating truly random numbers. From the definition of \"truly\", we understand that there should be absolutely no way to predict it, regardless of the information we have. Although it seems impossible to predict a random number without certain quantum-mechanical processes, since it would require knowing the state of every molecule in the atmosphere, we still cannot say that what we generate is truly random.\nBut then, how do we generate 'random' numbers? Well, the answer is, in most cases, random is not so random. That's when pseudorandomness steps into the scene.\nPseudo-random sequences typically exhibit statistical randomness while being generated by an entirely deterministic causal process.\nCryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) are very important in computing. Without them, we wouldn't have encryption algorithms. They emulate randomness by taking a statistically random sequence and using formulas to make it \"random enough\".\nThe math behind PRNG might be complex but in general, it requires two steps:\nProvide the PRNG with an arbitrary seed.\nAsk for the next random number.\nThe seed is a starting point for creating random numbers. If the seed changes, the generated numbers also change. If the same seed is used, the same number is generated. The current timestamp is often used as a unique seed value. That precise time never occurs again, so a PRNG with that seed should produce a unique set of random numbers.\nNow that we understand how random is not truly random and we can use pseudorandom with a seed to generate \"random enough\" numbers, let's see the ways of using PRNG in Rust and whether it is possible to do without extra dependencies. Unfortunately, there isn't a widely accepted and conventional way to generate random numbers by only using the core/standard library so we will have to be a little bit creative.\nBut hey, it will be fun!\nUsing rand\nProbably the most straightforward of generating random numbers is using the rand crate.\nHere are some examples:\nGenerates random numbers with help of random-number\ngenerator rand::Rng obtained via rand::thread_rng. Each thread has an\ninitialized generator. Integers are uniformly distributed over the range of the\ntype, and floating point numbers are uniformly distributed from 0 up to but not\nincluding 1.\nIf we want to give a seed and generate the same number every time we run the program, then we can change the PRNG implementation as follows:\nHowever, we're still far from our objective, which is generating random numbers without dependencies. Even rand with default features has several transitive dependencies:\nMaybe we can look into reducing the transitive dependency count somehow before trying to achieve our 0-dependency goal.\nI'm not sure how usable rand will be in this case, but we can simply remove the default features:\nThen we have:\nStill not looking good? Well, luckily, we have an alternative crate to use.\nUsing fastrand\nfastrand is a simple and fast random number generator that uses wyhash. This hash function is also simple and fast but not cryptographically secure.\nSo our previous examples with rand become the following:\nHow about our dependency count?\nWell, it's good, but still not quite there. Technically, this approach is not 0-deps since fastrand itself is a dependency to our program.\nOur goal is to have a single function that is simple enough for getting a random number every time we call it.\nHmm, let's see what we can do.\nZero-dependency Random Number Generation\nThere is more than one way to simulate entropy to generate random numbers and I will be mentioning the most suggested/interesting ways that I came across on Reddit and Rust users forum.\nNanoseconds\nHere is the poor man's random number generator which only takes the nanoseconds of the current time:\nIn this example, we take the current time which is expressed as duration since epoch, and extract the number of nanoseconds elapsed in the current second. For example, if the current time is \"10:20:30.123456789\" then our 'random' number will be 123456789. The problem here is that the number will be always between zero and 1 billion. We need to use a bit of modulo arithmetic to get a random number in the desired range.\nWell, this was suboptimal. Let's see what else we can do.\n/dev/urandom\nIn Unix-like operating systems, /dev/random and /dev/urandom are special files that serve as cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators. They allow access to environmental noise collected from device drivers and other sources.\nThe difference between /dev/random and /dev/urandom is that /dev/random only returns random bytes within the estimated number of bits of noise in the entropy pool whereas /dev/urandom does not block waiting for more entropy. Thus /dev/urandom is theoretically vulnerable to a cryptographic attack on the algorithms used by the driver and less random than /dev/random. /dev/random is more suitable for very high-quality randomness applications such as one-time pad or key generation.\n(If you would like to learn more about these magical files, see Myths about /dev/urandom)\nIn our case, we don't want to wait for the entropy pool until additional environmental noise is gathered so we can use /dev/urandom.\n(Edit after Foxboron's comment: Apparently since the March of 2022 / Kernel 5.6, there is no difference between /dev/random and /dev/urandom. See this article.)\nAn example usage of /dev/urandom which generates a random string is the following:\nIn Rust, we can utilize /dev/urandom like so:\nAlthough this solution will work perfectly fine on Unix-based operating systems, we won't be able to run this on other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows since /dev/urandom doesn't exist.\nBut hey, we got our RNG without extra dependencies!\nInterestingly enough, OsRng implementation of rand also depends on this approach:\nThe implementation is provided by the getrandom crate.\nAnd getrandom crate reads /dev/urandom under the hood:\nUses getrandom system call if available, otherwise /dev/urandom after successfully polling /dev/random.\nWait, did I just read \"getrandom system call\"? I wonder if we can we utilize that for generating random numbers.\ngetrandom(2)\nThe getrandom() system call fills the buffer pointed to by buf with up to buflen random bytes.\nThese bytes can be used to seed user-space random number generators or for cryptographic purposes.\nBy default, getrandom() draws entropy from the urandom source (i.e., the same source as the /dev/urandom device).\nThis behavior can be changed via the flags argument.\nIn order to use this system call in Rust, we need to define own our extern function or use the libc crate since Unix systems expose the syscalls through libc.\nIn our example, we defined an extern function with the same name as our system call (getrandom) to link to C library on the system so that we can interoperate with the C code. When we run this program, we can see that random seeds are generated using the getrandom() system call.\nThe downside of this approach is that it will only work on systems that getrandom() system call exists and it is inescapably using unsafe code.\nBut yeah, it is 0-deps on the surface, except the system call itself.\nrand() / srand()\nAnother external way of generating random numbers is to call the C library function rand(). Along with srand(), you can set the seed to use for a pseudorandom number generator. If srand() is not called, the rand() seed is set as if srand(1) was called at the program start.\nWe can implement this in Rust similar to getrandom() system call. For the seed, we can use the nanoseconds:\nThis has the same disadvantages as getrandom, it requires the C library for linking and has unsafe code.\ngetauxval(3)\nThe getauxval() function retrieves values from the auxiliary vector, a mechanism that the kernel's ELF binary loader uses to pass certain information to user space when a program is executed.\nEach entry in the auxiliary vector consists of a pair of values: a type that identifies what this entry represents, and a value for that type. Given the argument type, getauxval() returns the corresponding value.\nThe type argument of getauxval() (\"25\" in this case) is defined in libc as follows:\nThis solution was originally suggested by mina86ng on Reddit.\nRaw pointers\nLet's go for our last attempt.\nThe bottom line is, if we allocate something, take the pointer to it, retrieve the address, and cast it to an integer; we will get a random number. The address in the memory is not totally random, but probably random enough to do stuff™.\nThe problem with that approach is, apart from using a memory address for a random number, the numbers are always even since they are a memory address aligned to the size of an integer.\nAlso, the code above has memory leaks due to not handling the memory after calling Box::into_raw.\nSo we can edit the code as follows for manual cleanup by explicitly running the destructor and deallocating the memory:\nYay! No leaks.\nBut... Damn. Why are we even dealing with this? Let's just use a raw pointer via *const T:\nIn this example, obtaining an address like this is completely safe. But we will need to use unsafe Rust if we want to do anything with it.\nHowever, thanks to spacejam's comment, we can see that it is not a good entropy source.\nASLR (address space layout randomization) implementations tend to have weaknesses that manifest in ways that might not be obvious just looking at the scrambled output.\nMore succinctly:\nWhile the stack in the previous example gets a different distribution due to its reliance on a stack frame’s placement in the address space, there are still sharp edges about every system’s ASLR implementation that it’s kind of frustrating that only exploit writers seem to pay any attention to, despite their significant impacts on performance.\nAnother comment about how bad this approach would be is the following:\nThe \"randomness\" comes from ASLR, which is extremely limited on 32b systems (8~16 bits of entropy). 64b systems have more room, but it's still absolutely awful as an rng, IIRC on x86_64 Linux it defaults to 28 bits (you can check /proc/sys/vm/mmap_rnd_bits for the value on your system, last I checked it could be set from 28 to 32 inclusive).\nIf the allocator uses brk instead of mmap, it's worse, you get 13 bits of entropy out of the brk ASLR. Or less if you use huge pages.\nmasklinn on Reddit\nstd::collections::hash_map::RandomState\nThis solution was suggested by several people after I shared the blog post so thanks!\nSimply, we can use the RandomState of the standard library's HashMap implementation and generate a random number from the hasher:\nIt probably makes more sense to use these random values as seed rather than random number. For example, we can have the following function for generating a random seed and combine it with a suggestion by matklad:\nFinal thoughts\nOf course, there might be other ways to generate a random number without dependencies. This article aims to show the simplest ways without going too much into mathematical details.\nThanks to everyone who commented in the forums thread, it was definitely helpful to read all the replies!\nLet me know via the comments below if there are any other cool ways for generating random numbers.\nSee you next time! 🐻","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/zero-deps-random-in-rust/","title":"Zero-dependency random number generation in Rust"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/zig-bits-01/":{"body":"I decided to start a new blog series called \"Zig Bits\" where I share interesting bits of information about the Zig programming language. This series will be especially for beginners because I'm also a beginner.\nSince it's the first part of the series, let me start by giving some information about Zig and my background.\nZig is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.\nRobust: Behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out of memory.\nOptimal: Write programs the best way they can behave and perform.\nReusable: The same code works in many environments which have different constraints.\nMaintainable: Precisely communicate intent to the compiler and other programmers. The language imposes a low overhead to reading code and is resilient to changing requirements and environments.\nIt supports compile-time generics, reflection and evaluation, cross-compilation, and manual memory management. A major goal of Zig is to improve upon the C language, while also taking inspiration from Rust, among others.\nThere are a lot of resources to learn Zig, primarily:\nZig Documentation\nZig std Reference\nZiglearn.org\nZig Crash Course\nZig Strings in 5 minutes\nI usually develop in Rust and I decided to learn Zig because the low-levelness of the language piqued my interest. I always liked writing C and learning something more robust is something that I would definitely consider. I'm already writing my first Zig project in my spare time (from other open source projects) and I really enjoy it!\nAlright, it's time for the main event.\nReturning a slice in Zig\nHere's the code snippet for demonstrating what we're trying to do:\nQ: Cool! So we're just returning a slice from a function and printing its value?\nYes! We're expecting to see zigbits two times. One from inside the function and one from the main.\nLet's run it:\nUhm... What? That's not what we expected. Maybe run it again?\nWTH?! Maybe print the u8 array instead?\nThat's not the same array! What is going on here?\nExplanation\nLet's look at this line:\nHere, we're actually returning a slice of a stack-allocated array.\nSince the array is allocated on the stack, it could be corrupted when it's released i.e. when we return from the function. This is explained in the Lifetime and Ownership part of the documentation:\nIt is the Zig programmer's responsibility to ensure that a pointer is not accessed when the memory pointed to is no longer available. Note that a slice is a form of pointer, in that it references other memory.\nThis is the reason why we get random gibberish when we try to print the array contents after returning from the function.\nAlso, there is an issue in the ziglang/zig repository about this which states that this situation should lead to a compile error: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/5725\nSolution\nWe can work around this in a couple of ways:\nPassing the slice in as a parameter to the function\nMaking the array global\nAllocating the slice (returning an allocated copy of the slice) [most common]\nLet's see how it works with each solution.\nPassing the slice as a parameter\nThe number of bytes written is unknown to main, and thus without the len, the debug log at the end will print the entire buffer, and not just the actual message part.\nAs you can see, we have updated the return value of the function to void and make it accept a slice parameter. Instead of return, we update the slice with std.mem.cpy method in the function and return length of the message. This length will be used in main to print the actual message part, not the entire buffer which may contain some garbage.\n(This approach is similar to passing a mutable reference (&amp;mut) to a function in Rust.)\nLet's run it:\nYay!\nUsing a global array\nWe have declared the array literal as top-level so it is lazily analyzed and accessible from the inner scopes.\nAllocating the slice\nWe're making a copy of the slice on the heap on this line:\nThis makes the slice available outside the function since it's now allocated on the heap:\nMore common and idiomatic way of handling such case would be passing a std.mem.Allocator to the function that allocates memory. This way, we can allow the caller to decide which allocator to use.\nBonus\nLet's improve our program to return a slice with a designated length instead of stack allocated array.\nThis will also work since we're not returning the address of the array: not work too! (Thanks for the correction everyone!)\nIt's the same dangling pointer problem as in the first example. Both &amp;message and message[0..] in Zig will return the same slice.\n@zenith391 explained really well why this example might have worked during my tests but it's still an undefined behavior:\nIn the first example, the problem was that it was allocated on the stack and then freed. Now suppose calling std.log.debug takes 8 bytes of stack space. But then calling std.log.debug causes more stack to be allocated, so it happily reuses and overwrites the bytes used for \"zigbits\".\nThe reason why it doesn't do that when the return type is ![]u8 is because an error union type like ![]u8 takes more stack bytes than []u8 which means our \"zigbits\" bytes are allocated farther in the stack.\nThe result is that when std.log.debug consumes its (hypothetical) 8 bytes of stack, it doesn't take enough to overwrite \"zigbits\".\nYou can check this behavior with https://godbolt.org/z/cPWjajYxb which shows that \"zigbits\" is placed 40 bytes into the stack when using ![]u8 but only 16 bytes into the stack when using []u8.\nOf course if you allocate more stack bytes (by making variables or calling more functions) it will eventually overwrite \"zigbits\". This also means this bonus snippet suffers from the same problem.\nTLDR: Because ![]u8 is bigger, you have to use more of the stack in order to overwrite \"zigbits\"\nConclusion\nI'm fairly new to Zig and I really enjoy learning these concepts. Let me know via the comments below if I missed something or if there is an easier way.\nAny feedback is welcome!\nHere is the next post of the Zig Bits series!

I have learned that Zig arrays are allocated on the stack and they could be corrupted when they are accessed in the case that memory pointed to them are no longer available. It was fun.\nSome people also pointed out that one of the examples I gave wasn't idiomatic:\nHere you can see that I used a hardcoded std.heap.page_allocator for duplicating the memory. However, the Zig convention for allocation is that we declare an allocator at another higher-scoped unit of code and then pass the allocator as an argument to the function like the following:\nThis way, the callers can decide the allocator type due to it being defined as generic std.mem.Allocator.\nNow that this allocator usage is made clear, let's bear this in mind and jump right into our example program for Zig Bits part 2!\nConcatenating paths\nHere is our example program which simply aims to concatenate filesystem paths and print the result:\nAs you might have guessed, the main thing we should focus on in this program is the concatPath function. It takes a generic allocator type (allocator) and concatenates the given p1 and p2 path strings. It also prepends \"/home\" to the final path. Very cool!\nQ: Alright, we got it. Are you gonna run the damn thing?\nOh yeah, sure:\nAs you can see everything worked and we have successfully printed out the final path.\nSee you in the next post!\nQ: Uhhh, that can't be it, right?\nOf course not! Don't you see the memory leak there!?\nQ: What?\nYou heard me. Right there!\nQ: It is pretty much impossible to see where you are pointing at right now.\nOkay okay, let's take a step back and start over.\nExplanation\nWhat even is a memory leak and why does it happen?\nImagine you're on vacation in Costa Rica and you come across an iguana sanctuary where they let you feed the iguanas. You start feeding them and soon realize that they have bottomless stomachs! No matter how much you feed them, they keep eating and eating until they become giant, indigestible beasts.\nIn computer programming, a memory leak is like those insatiable iguanas - a program keeps consuming more and more memory without any limit. Just like the iguanas are never full, the program fails to release the memory it has used, causing a continual drain on the computer's resources. This can slow down or even crash the system if enough memory is consumed.\nMemory leaks are often caused by programming mistakes, like failing to release memory when it's no longer needed. They can also occur due to inefficient code or poorly designed algorithms. But just like not giving into the iguanas' endless hunger, programmers need to identify and fix memory leaks to prevent their programs from becoming giant, unmanageable beasts.\nQ: Okay you had your fun with ChatGPT, now, how do we check if we have memory leaks in our program?\nBefore I show the conventional way of checking memory leaks, let's try something traditional: Valgrind!\nChecking memory leaks with Valgrind\nQ: A-ha! I knew that you were trolling me. Where is the memory leak?\nDon't jump to the conclusion that quickly. Apparently, we need to switch to the C allocator so that Valgrind can trace memory allocations correctly via preloading:\nLet's check if our program is still working properly:\nAh, right. We need to link against libc in build.zig:\nLet's run Valgrind again:\nBingo! You can see from this output that our concatPath function actually leaks memory:\nQ: Nice. But this Valgrind setup seems to require a bit of work and it requires libc. Isn't there a more native and recommended way of checking memory leaks in Zig?\nGood question. Of course, there is!\nUsing std.testing.allocator for detecting memory leaks\nWhen code allocates memory using the Zig standard library's testing allocator, std.testing.allocator, the default test runner will report any leaks that are found from using the testing allocator.\nFor utilizing this, we can modify our program to add a simple test case that will check the expected output:\nLet's run the tests:\nGreat! We just spotted a memory leak from the tests.\nThat's something very powerful when you think of it. Also, it definitely makes testing the Zig code more important.\nQ: It's cool and all but I still don't know how to fix the memory leak.\nOh, that... Follow me.\nSolution\nThe solution is to free the memory after using it. In other words, we need to free the memory allocated by path at the end of the program. Luckily, allocators in Zig have free() method for freeing arrays.\nQ: So we will just call allocator.free(path); at the end of the program?\nYes, but not quite. It would not be very convenient for having a lot of free calls at the end of our program. For example, in C, cleaning stuff up can leave a large distance between where the resource was acquired and where it is disposed of. However, in Zig, we have defer statement for that purpose. It allows us to put the resource acquisition and disposal immediately next to each other in the code. For example:\nIt is a pattern that is often used when we acquire some sort of resource and want to ensure that the resource is dispensed with before we return, or otherwise leave a scope. Common use cases for defer are things like files or memory, but it can be anything, and any code too; the defer statement can accept a block of code if necessary. The only exception is, we can't use a return statement from defer.\nLet's modify our program to free the allocated memory at the end of the scope by using defer:\nLet's run the tests now:\nYay! No leaks 💯\nFor making it more clear, we can take a look how defer works under scopes:\nBonus I\nIt was also pointed on Discord by rimuspp#1713 that there is another way of dealing with leaks: using the general purpose allocator!\nThis will leak and report on the main program itself:\nThis approach is also what powers std.testing.allocator.\nBonus II\nAnother use case for defer is file operations such as creating/opening a file:\nIn this example, we are reading a number of bytes from an arbitrary file with readBytes function. As you can see, defer can be used to close the file at the end of a function. Also, we are using it for freeing the memory in the tests as shown before.\nAlternatively, it is possible to use errdefer for cases that we want to execute something if the scope returns with an error:\nWhen we run it:\nConclusion\nIn Zig, the most convenient way of detecting memory leaks seems to test the code via std.testing.allocator. For that, we need to structure our program to pass std.mem.Allocator to the functions that allocate memory. After that, we can use the free() method of the allocator to free the memory.\nIn that case, defer statement is handy for ensuring that the cleanup will happen at the end of the scope. It can also be used for different purposes that require execution when leaving the scope.\nHope you enjoyed the read, any feedback is welcome!

I'm also giving a brief introduction to my first-ever Zig project \"linuxwave\" which led to the writing of this series.\nRecently, I shared my first Zig project called \"linuxwave\" which is a simple command-line tool for generating music from a (random) stream of data. I will talk about it more at the end of this post.\nWhile writing Zig in the past months, I sometimes had a hard time figuring out what to do or which way to go to efficiently do a certain thing. During those times, I either went for a hunt in the wild interwebs or asked a question in the Discord server of Zig. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of documentation so I turned this getting help process into writing blog posts and sharing my findings. Here are the first 2 parts of this series which came out exactly in the way that I described - me trying to figure out things:\nZig Bits 0x1: Returning slices from functions\nZig Bits 0x2: Using defer to defeat memory leaks\nIn the meantime, I was working on my project and writing Zig at every chance that I get. I must say, I absolutely enjoyed this process since it's been a while since I learned something low-level like Zig. Actually, it's been a while since I learned a new programming language as well. Development was really fun.\nHowever, like every good thing, this had an end. After the core functionality is there and the Zig code is thoroughly tested, I started to do chores that are more related to project management rather than actual development. Although it is sometimes boring, I still believe that doing grunt tasks is also important since it makes you able to efficiently maintain the project and paves the way for new contributors.\nSo I will be sharing my experience of project management in Zig to document what could be done to achieve a better stance for your Zig project in the open-source community. This could also be perceived as me trying to apply the same open-source maintenance techniques that I use for my Rust projects to a Zig project.\nI will cover the following topics:\nAdding libraries\nRunning tests\nCode coverage\nDocumentation generation\nCI/CD\nSo let's jump right into it.\nAdding libraries ⚡\nFor newcomers, this is one of the prominent questions. Currently, there does not seem to be an easy and standard way like cargo add for adding libraries to your Zig project. However, there are some package managers available for this purpose:\ngyro: A Zig package manager with an index, build runner, and build dependencies.\nzigmod: A package manager for the Zig programming language.\naquila: A package index for Zig projects.\nFor my project, I followed a more straightforward approach: Git Submodules!\n1- Create libs directory at the root of your project.\n2- Add the library as a git submodule:\nEither run git submodule add &lt;remote_url&gt; libs/&lt;lib&gt; or add .gitmodules file. For example, for zig-clap:\n3- Then you need to add the package to your project in build.zig as follows:\n4- Now you can import the library from your source files like this:\nHejsil summarizes this very well in this issue:\nRight now, there is no standard way to install Zig libraries. There are a few common ways people do it:\ngit submodule or copying and pasting the library into their own project.\nAfter this, you can add exe.addPackagePath(\"clap\", \"path/to/clap.zig\"); to your build.zig file to use the library\nUse an unofficial package manager such as zigmod or gyro\nLook at the docs for these package managers for how to install packages using them. They should both be able to install zig-clap as far as I know.\nRunning tests ⚡\nWhile writing tests for my project, I realized I need to add tests for each file and specify which files to test in build.zig. For example:\nWhen I run this code with zig build test, it will only run the tests in main.zig. What I wanted is to run the tests in every file in my project so I did the most obvious thing that comes to mind:\nThis works just fine but there is also another way (and a better way) of doing this which is mentioned in this Reddit thread.\nYou need to have a common file that \"references\" the testing code for them to be run by a single \"addTest\" statement in your build file. For example, in src/myLibrary.zig:\nThen in build.zig, you can simply add it as b.addTest(\"src/myLibrary.zig\").\nCode coverage ⚡\nOne of the cool things you can do is to track how much of your tests cover your code. This also helps with testing the functionality better and potentially eliminating bugs. Sometimes you even need to refactor your code to write tests for a certain function/module which makes the code better at the end of the day.\nIn Rust projects, I usually follow this path for testing/coverage:\nWrite tests\nRun them using cargo-nextest\nGenerate code coverage report with a tool\ncargo-tarpaulin\ncargo-llvm-cov\nUpload it to Codecov.io\nFor Zig, we will do the following:\nWrite tests\nRun them using zig build test\nGenerate code coverage report with kcov\nUpload it to Codecov.io\nAfter the tests are passed, the first step is to generate a code coverage report. While researching this topic, I came across this article that tells you how you can do that with kcov.\nWe simply need to add a new flag in build.zig for generating the coverage report:\nNow when you run zig build test -Dtest-coverage, the report will be generated in kcov-output.\nNeat!\nThe next step is to upload this report to Codecov. I put together a simple GitHub Actions workflow for that purpose:\nAnd here we go: https://app.codecov.io/gh/orhun/linuxwave\nDocumentation generation ⚡\nIn Chapter 3 of Ziglearn, the documentation generation is explained in detail:\nThe Zig compiler comes with automatic documentation generation. This can be invoked by adding -femit-docs to your zig build-{exe, lib, obj} or zig run command. This documentation is saved into ./docs, as a small static website.\nThis generation is experimental, and often fails with complex examples. This is used by the standard library documentation.\nSo we simply need to activate the emit_docs flag for the auto-generation of the documentation. As a bonus, I recommend adding a flag in build.zig as follows:\nAfter this, you can generate the documentation via zig build -Ddocs=true.\nThe generated static site in docs/ looks like this:\nIt is cool but I would like to go one step further and deploy this site to GitHub Pages.\nI don't find it feasible to maintain the docs/ folder in the repository so I added it to the .gitignore. What I want instead is to auto-generate the documentation and deploy it when I push commits to the main branch.\nTo do that, you first need to enable GitHub Actions feature for the GitHub Pages:\nRepository -&gt; Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Build and deployment -&gt; Source -&gt; Select GitHub Actions instead of the legacy Deploy from a branch option.\nAfter that, we can simply add the following workflow file for deploying the documentation to the GitHub Pages:\nYou can check out the deployment under Settings &gt; Pages:\nAs an example, see the documentation of my project here: https://orhun.dev/linuxwave/docs/\nCI/CD ⚡\nLastly, let's set up a CI/CD workflow for our project. There will be 2 workflow files:\nci.yml: for making sure that the project builds fine.\ntriggered via pushing a commit\ncd.yml: for distributing pre-built binaries for different platforms.\ntriggered via pushing a tag\nContinuous Integration\nHere is a GitHub Actions workflow file that automates the process of building, testing, and checking the formatting of a project every time there's a push or a pull request to the main branch:\nThe binary is tested for 3 different optimization profiles:\nReleaseFast\nFast runtime performance\nSafety checks disabled\nSlow compilation speed\nLarge binary size\nReleaseSafe\nMedium runtime performance\nSafety checks enabled\nSlow compilation speed\nLarge binary size\nReleaseSmall\nMedium runtime performance\nSafety checks disabled\nSlow compilation speed\nSmall binary size\nContinuous Deployment\nHere is a GitHub Actions workflow file that automates the process of building a binary for a specific target and publishing it on GitHub every time there is a new version tag pushed to the repository:\nAs you can see here, it is really easy to cross-compile Zig projects by only providing the -Dtarget option.\nTARGET variable in this workflow consists of 2 parts:\nCPU architecture (e.g. x86_64)\nOperating system (e.g. linux)\nYou can get more information about cross compilation here.\nlinuxwave 🐧🎵\nIt is time for the main event.\nClick here to watch the demo!\nlinuxwave is a command-line tool written in Zig for generating music from the entropy of the Linux kernel (/dev/urandom). It can also encode WAV files as a music composition from a given input file.\nHere are some examples:\nUse A minor blues scale:\nRead from an arbitrary file and turn it into a 10-second music composition:\nGenerate a calming music:\nGenerate a chiptune music:\nMore examples/presets are available in the repository.\n✨ It is up to your imagination to generate fancy stuff!\n⚡ GitHub: https://github.com/orhun/linuxwave\nConclusion\nBefore anyone comments about the title of this post, I must admit that we didn't actually master the project management in Zig completely (yet). But that was the most fitting title that ChatGPT suggested based on my bullet points so I decided to roll with it.\nI believe I covered a couple of important techniques and best practices for efficiently managing open-source Zig projects. I might share more stuff about this topic in the future and feel free to let me know if you have additional tips or any questions!\nI hope you enjoy the stuff you generate with linuxwave! Feel free to share them here.\nHere is the next post of the Zig Bits series! (\"Building an HTTP client/server from scratch\")\nsayonara!","description":"","id":"https://blog.orhun.dev/zig-bits-03/","title":"Zig Bits 0x3: Mastering project management in Zig"},"https://blog.orhun.dev/zig-bits-04/":{"body":"Let's experiment with the std.http module of Zig &gt;=0.11 and create an HTTP server/client from scratch (along with some benchmarks)!\nNote: The standard library has changed since the writing of this article. Updated source code for the HTTP server portion can be found at the end of this article.\nWhile learning a new programming language, one of the things that is always on my mind is if it is possible/easy to write an HTTP server/client with it. It might be due to the nature of my industrial orientation as a backend/systems engineer, or it is because the networking-related implementations were always a bit scary to me. In time, I think I overcame this fear quite a bit, thanks to the well-documented and beginner-friendly HTTP server/client libraries in Rust. To give some names and a kind shout-out to the maintainers: reqwest, ureq and hyper are very pleasant to work with in that regard. They just do the job, and I appreciate it when things work out of the box without too much trouble.\nBut now, we are in the Ziguana territory. Ever since I started writing Zig for creating small programs and writing this series, I have been wondering how high-level I can get with such a low-level systems language. Today, I'm hoping to answer that question.\nQ: So, what is the plan?\nA: I heard that the Zig standard library will have some exciting HTTP features starting from 0.11.0. As a first step, let's experiment with the new stuff™ and try to come up with something functional. Also, I'm curious about the performance/speed aspect of things. For that, I will be creating some benchmarks to see the comparison with other programming languages such as Rust.\nLooking into std.http\nBuilding an HTTP client\nBonus: git-yolo\nBuilding an HTTP server\nBenchmarks\nQ: Aight, so we goin' full nerd mode?\nA: I'm a teapot.\nLooking into std.http ⚡\nZig finally got the built-in HTTP server/client support in the past months:\nComing Soon to a Zig Near You: HTTP Client (technical overview)\nHTTP server in the standard library (tracking issue)\nZig now has built-in HTTP server and client in std (HN discussion)\nTo summarize the features of this newly added std.http module:\nOnly available in Zig 0.11.0-dev.2675-0eebc2588 and above.\nSupports HTTP/1.1 (however, see A barely HTTP/2 server in Zig for an interesting read!)\nSupports features such as connection pooling, compressed content, proxying and TLS.\nAnd I think the most exciting part is:\nWith a fresh install of Zig, we can fetch the contents of a website or send a POST request with no extra hassle of finding an extra library to provide those features for us.\nQ: It is cool and all, but is it easy to use? Show me the code already.\nA: Slown, let's take a look at the available types and methods in std.http first.\nAt the time of writing this blog post, std.http has the following API:\nClient: HTTP client implementation.\nServer: HTTP server implementation.\nConnection: Connection type (keep_alive, close)\nContentEncoding: Content encoding options (compress, deflate, gzip and zstd)\nField: Common type for name and value\nHeaders: HTTP headers\nMethod: HTTP methods such as GET and POST\nStatus: HTTP status codes (not_found = 404, teapot = 418, etc.)\nTransferEncoding: Form of encoding used to transfer the body (chunked)\nVersion: Currently HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1\nAs you can already tell, it is a very straightforward HTTP implementation, and you might even figure out the usage just by looking at the available types (if you have magical powers or something). Compared to the current stable version of Zig (0.10.1), std.http is not that barebones and got some cool additions such as content/transfer encodings and headers, which is very cool!\nQ: Enough fiddling around man, are you going to write the code now?\nA: Uh, yeah. Let's do that before you throw a hissy fit.\nQ: I would nev--\nBuilding an HTTP client ⚡\nI will be assuming that you have Zig 0.11.0 installed!\nBefore everything, we need to choose an allocator to use. This is one of the fun aspects of Zig where you get to choose exactly how the memory allocations are done. I highly recommend reading about allocators or the previous episodes of these series where I weigh on this topic.\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's go with std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator which is a safe allocator which can prevent double-free, use-after-free, and can detect leaks.\nAs the next step, let's create our Client object. It is fairly straightforward:\nAs you can see, the only parameter that is needed to create a Client is the allocator. Optionally, you can provide a certificate bundle, connection pool, and proxy during construction.\nAnother thing to note here is the defer keyword. It instructs that the deinit method will be called when the client goes out of scope which means all the associated resources with the client will be released. For more information, you can give it a read to the part 0x2 of this series.\nOkay, now let's make a GET call to a website and get the result as text.\nQ: Any brilliant ideas about which site to use?\nA: You bet!\nhttps://whatthecommit.com: commit message generator\nI also use this website in a git alias as follows:\nSo when I need a dummy commit, I just go:\nSuch a fun command!\nQ: Ahem, aren't you derailing from the topic?\nA: Ah, yeah, sorry.\nTo send a request, we will need a few things:\na std.http.Method\na std.Uri\nparsed from an URL.\na std.http.Headers\nfor holding the headers sent to the server.\nit will only allocate memory if we append anything to it.\nAnd here is how we can put these parameters together:\nNow, we are ready to create a Request object:\nAnd that's it!\nQ: That's it what? I don't see anything happening.\nA: You're right. We only formed a connection to the server now. To actually send the request, we need to use the start function as follows:\nQ: Oh god, I hate extra steps!\nA: Think about it in a different way, this approach comes in handy when you need to manipulate the request before sending it. For example,\nQ: Oooh, that makes sense.\nA: Well, if you hate extra steps, we have one other step to go.\nQ: Geez, what now!?\nAfter sending the request, we need to wait for server to send us a response:\nThis wait call will handle the following tasks for us:\nRedirects\nReading/storing headers\nSetting up decompression\nLastly, to read the response from the server, we can use the reader() method of Request and get a std.io.Reader. The rest is simply reading from a stream in Zig:\nAnd here is how it is all put together with printing out the response:\nLet's run it!\nQ: Oops, what happened?\nA: Uhhhh...\nWith a little bit of digging, I found an issue in the Zig repository:\nhttps://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/14172 (test std lib TLS implementation against many real world servers)\nIt turns out, current TLS implementation in the standard library only supports TLS 1.3.\nHere are some comments regarding this:\n@dadrian: I assume the decision to only support 1.3 is at least semi-intentional, since 1.3 and 1.2 have different state machines.\n@jedisct1: Eventually, everybody's gonna move to TLS 1.3. I'm not sure that it's worth investing time in a TLS 1.2 implementation today, especially since TLS 1.2 has a lot of footguns.\nAnd unfortunately, our beloved website whatthecommit.com uses TLS 1.2:\nAlso, we can check the TLS 1.3 support by running:\nRIP.\nQ: So, what do we do now?\nA: Luckily I have set up a similar website in the past which can be used for testing in our case (and it supports TLS 1.3).\nhttps://godsays.xyz: random text generator\nIt is simply a website that spits out random sequence of words from a predefined wordlist every time you refresh it. What, you ask why this exists?\nTerrence Andrew Davis (December 15, 1969 – August 11, 2018) was an American programmer who created and designed the operating system TempleOS alone. It was a highly complex and unusual undertaking for one person, as the project extended to building core components such as programming language, editor, compiler and kernel virtually from scratch.\nContained in Terry's TempleOS masterpiece were various random text generators. Terry believed that by generating this text one could \"speak to God\".\nSo I reproduced this logic in Rust and created a simple CLI program (godsays) and a webserver (godsays-server) for extended use cases.\nRepository: https://github.com/orhun/godsays\nSo we can simply update the URL in our program and try running it again as follows:\nYay, it worked! We successfully sent a GET request to a server and printed out the response.\nQ: What about POST requests?\nA: Good question. Right after we send the request, we can write to it as follows:\nAnd that concludes the HTTP client part, what an adventure!\nBonus: git-yolo ⚡\nHere is the semi-real-world application where I used the HTTP client from the Zig standard library to fetch a random commit message from whatthecommit.com (let's assume it works) and run the git-commit command for creating dummy commits with a random message.\nBuilding an HTTP server ⚡\nNow that the easy part is done, let's get to the real deal: the HTTP server.\nFor the following implementation, I took some inspiration from the tests in the standard library and came up with a simplified version of it without multithreading and assertions. But don't worry, we will build something functional and easily extensible for different use-cases.\nTo keep it simple, I think adding a single route as /get is enough. And why not return \"Zig Bits!\" from it?\nSo, here is what we simply want:\nQ: Did you know that you can create an HTTP server in Python in a single line? Try python -m http.server 8000.\nA: Don't care + didn't ask + L + Ratio\nLet's quickly define our constants for the server configuration:\nOne thing to note here is that we specified a scope for the log module so the log messages will appear as info(server), debug(server), etc. which is quite useful if you decide to implement other logging scopes one day.\nNext, we need to choose an allocator to use (as we did the same with the HTTP client). I would like to go with std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator once again for consistency with the HTTP client example.\nGreat, now it is the time to construct our Server object and instruct that the resources will be freed when it goes out of scope.\nTo bind the server to the address we have defined before:\nQ: This is going scaringly easy and straightforward. Hmm, what are the next steps?\nA: Yeah, as you can see Zig is pretty easy at times. Now, we will define 2 functions to run the server and handle the requests.\nQ: Fu-\nAs in every HTTP server implementation, we need a mechanism to block the current thread, wait for the next request and handle it. To do that in Zig, we will do the following:\naccept method of Server returns a Response.\nResponse contains useful information such as request method and headers.\nResponse also has helper methods for working with the requests. For example, wait method can be used to wait for client to complete the request head.\nWhen we put it all together, the server runner function looks like this:\nHere, we first create an infinite loop for accepting the incoming connections. Then there is another loop constructed for reading the response from a stream with the wait method. Also, the infinite loop is marked as outer to skip the response from the reader loop if the headers are invalid.\nAs you can see, the request is processed as the last step in the server loop via handleRequest function.\nThis is where the actual magic happens:\nLet's break it down:\nFirst, the details of the incoming request are logged.\nRequest body is being read and the memory is allocated respectfully (max 8KBs).\nConnection header is set if necessary.\nIf the request target is starting with /get, then write \"Zig Bits!\" to the response body and return it with \"text/plain\" Content-Type header.\nEnable the chunked encoding if the target contains ?chunked, use a fixed content length otherwise.\nReturn 404 if the request is not matched i.e. route is not configured.\nOne little detail to give attention to is the difference between the finish() and do() methods of the Response. do() method simply sends the response headers, whereas finish() will send the final chunk for chunked messages or verify that we upheld our agreement to send a certain number of bytes. So if we are sending data, we should always finish off the response by calling finish().\nNow that the requests are handled and we have our server functions, here is how we run the server and log the errors:\nFinal HTTP server code:\nLet's run it!\nOn another terminal:\nNeat, now we have a functional HTTP server written purely in Zig!\nBenchmarks ⚡\nFor seeing the speed of the Zig HTTP client compared to implementations in other programming languages, I created some benchmarks using hyperfine.\nThe benchmarks can be found in this repo: https://github.com/orhun/zig-http-benchmarks\nCurrently, I'm comparing the HTTP client against:\nRust HTTP client (hyper, reqwest, ureq, attohttpc)\nGo HTTP client (net/http)\nPython HTTP client (requests)\ncurl\nThe way it works is I run the Zig HTTP server and accept N number of requests from different clients and let the hyperfine do its magic.\nTo run the benchmarks, simply run ./bench.sh:\nCommandMean [ms]Min [ms]Max [ms]Relative\ncurl295.2 ± 29.3248.6367.94.25 ± 0.73\nzig-http-client150.9 ± 38.198.5250.22.17 ± 0.63\nrust-attohttpc133.4 ± 20.6101.1174.71.92 ± 0.40\nrust-hyper82.1 ± 10.165.7106.01.18 ± 0.22\nrust-reqwest90.0 ± 14.067.8126.01.30 ± 0.27\nrust-ureq69.5 ± 9.655.392.91.00\ngo-http-client120.8 ± 20.084.6171.61.74 ± 0.38\npython-http-client716.5 ± 22.0665.9765.710.31 ± 1.47\nHere is the whisker plot:\nThanks to @dnaka91 &amp; @truemedian for helping to make the comparison more fair!\nConclusion ⚡\nI am still a beginner to Zig and learning new things as I experiment, so any comments about improving the code in any way is highly appreciated.
